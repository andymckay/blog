<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_People_%28song%29">Twenty years ago today (May 22nd 1995)</a>, Pulp released the single "Common People":

What a song. Unfortunately, that version is censored. At point 2 mins 30 seconds the lyrics are:

<blockquote>
You'll never watch your life slide out of view,
and dance and drink and screw
Because there's nothing else to do.
</blockquote>

The vevo version on youtube omits "and screw". This song has some great lyrics:

<blockquote>
Smoke some fags and play some pool, pretend you never went to school.
But still you'll never get it right
'cos when you're laid in bed at night watching roaches climb the wall
If you call your Dad he could stop it all.
</blockquote>

This was a defining song of the britpop era and I can remember it clearly being part of an Oasis (Manchester) vs Pulp (London) rivalry.

Of course, you haven't made it until William Shatner covers it:

Of that Jarvis said:

<blockquote>
In 2011 Jarvis Cocker praised the cover version: "I was very flattered by that because I was a massive Star Trek fan as a kid and so you know, Captain Kirk is singing my song! So that was amazing."
</blockquote>

Apparently the subject of song is a lady who might have been named Danae, my wife's name.

There is a documentary about Pulp I haven't seen:

I'm now going to go listen to every Pulp song ever.
