<hr class="florished">
<p>Had the pleasure of heading down to Seattle yesterday to talk at the Seattle Plone User Group. Lovely group of people I seem to be knowing well, but was still a pleasure to put a few new faces to names. I had a talk about Content Mirror prepared. Unfortunately some people did come to hear about jquery, that was going to be the topic of my talk, but to be honest doing cross-domain work in JSONP in Plone is cool but only a 5 minute talk.</p>
<p>Anyway the talk went really well. I have to say I was quite pumped afterwards, I've had a string of bad talks. One lesson there is talk about what you feel passionately about. I do think Content Mirror is pretty cool and would love to use it on sites. Or perhaps just Plone as the new uber-Django admin interface.</p>
<p>The talk is here: <a href="/files/content-mirror.pdf">Content Mirror</a></p>
<p>Plango, my quick Django front end for it is in: <a href="http://svn.clearwind.ca/public/django/plango">SVN</a>, although this might get moved over to the Content Mirror repository.</p>
<p>People then kindly put up with me talking about the next version of Arecibo and that seemed to go down well too. Short on time right now, so I'll get a more coherent post together when I have time.</p>
<p>Afterwards a nice Thai dinner. Thanks for looking for after me folks.</p>
