        <title>Panorama Ridge</title>

            &lt;p&gt;For some reason Panorama Ridge has been on my list for a long time, but I haven&#39;t gone. Partly it was confusion on my part about how to get up to Panorama Ridge and how long the trail actually. Turns out it&#39;s really easy to get to and well worth it. Unfortunately judging by the numbers of people I saw and the posts on &lt;code&gt;/r/vancouverhiking&lt;/code&gt; it looks like it&#39;s getting overwhelmed by people, rather like Joffre Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need day passes, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://bcparks.ca/garibaldi-park/&#34;&gt;camping passes from BC Parks&lt;/a&gt; to visit this part of Garibaldi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1-chekamus-helm-creek&#34;&gt;Day 1: Chekamus üëâ Helm Creek&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;strava-embed-placeholder&#34; data-embed-type=&#34;activity&#34; data-embed-id=&#34;15684874430&#34; data-style=&#34;standard&#34; data-from-embed=&#34;false&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main ways in towards this area, via Helm Creek (from the north) or via Taylor Meadows (from the south). The Helm Creek route is the furthest and comes in from Cheakamus Lake. As with all these trails, its not technical and is an easy surface to hike on. In 8km it has almost 800m of elevation, but most of that comes in the last 6km of the hike. It starts off with steep switchbacks, but calms down after a well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helm Creek has bear caches, a couple of toilets and lots of tent pads spread out across the campsite. With Black Tusk visible from the campsite, it&#39;s a lovely spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night a helicopter and crew came into to take out someone who accidentally set off a bear spray canister into their face. Number of times I&#39;ve seen bear spray set off at a bear: &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, number of times I&#39;ve seen set off accidentally: &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-2-garibaldi-day-2-helm-creek-panorama-ridge&#34;&gt;Day 2: Garibaldi Day 2: Helm Creek üëâ Panorama Ridge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;strava-embed-placeholder&#34; data-embed-type=&#34;activity&#34; data-embed-id=&#34;15684943622&#34; data-style=&#34;standard&#34; data-from-embed=&#34;false&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left my tent and gear at Helm Creek and moved the essentials into a smaller day bag. This was a pretty common approach, some people took their tent down and just put their backpack up the bear cache. It meant a light pack to tackle Panorama Ridge. The hike up towards the trail intersection is easy going, as you approach areas of lava rock that create big flat areas of black rock, right underneath Black Tusk. It reminded of volcanoes in New Zealand and was something I hadn&#39;t really experienced in BC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paths up to Black Tusk and the one up to Panorama Ridge are near each other. From that point it&#39;s 400m climb up a ridge and too the top. I never felt exposed or nervous, the trail was pretty wide and felt good. There was one small part as it worked its way to the very top, but that was short lived and wasn&#39;t a problem for someone like me who is not keen on large drops or exposure. The top is absolutely stunning and had absolutely amazing views. I can see why its popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/files/IMG_2814.jpeg&#34; class=&#34;img-fluid&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left early in the morning and as I was heading down, more and more people were coming up. Runners and others from Rubble Creek via Taylor Meadows were also appearing. I can see this place being very, very busy. One brief diversion of the main trail and I found the place where people go to the toilet and sadly leave their toilet paper (leave no trace people). It was a depressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain lakes swum in: 2Ô∏è‚É£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to have a nice swim in the lake, sunbathe and be back at Helm Creek in the early afternoon. I was tempted to just pack up and hike out, since I didn&#39;t figure it would take too long, but in the end I decided to enjoy another night in a lovely campsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-3-helm-creek-cheakamus&#34;&gt;Day 3: Helm Creek üëâ Cheakamus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;strava-embed-placeholder&#34; data-embed-type=&#34;activity&#34; data-embed-id=&#34;15684943044&#34; data-style=&#34;standard&#34; data-from-embed=&#34;false&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&#34;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty straightforward hike out, due it being downhill pretty much all the way it passed really quickly. I enjoyed the sun rising and seeing the sunlight come in through the trees as I made my way down. It only took 1h 46m for me to get back to the car. Then it was drive out on the 8km of unpaved road to Function Junction feeling pretty happy and satisfied. This would be a nice opportunity to divert over to Cheakamus Lake if you fancied another mountain lake swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall a great hike with &lt;strong&gt;amazing&lt;/strong&gt; views, but concerns about the overcrowding. I&#39;d happily consider doing this in one day, or perhaps a loop up from one end to the other taking in Black Tusk next time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Big Agnes Tiger Wall UL2 Tent</title>

        <content type="html">
            &lt;p&gt;Last year I bought the &lt;a href=&#34;/2024-09-06-another-tent.html&#34;&gt;Big Agnes UL1 Tent&lt;/a&gt; which was a replacement for my &lt;a href=&#34;/2022-04-04-a-tent.html&#34;&gt;Tarptent ProTrail&lt;/a&gt;. I liked the Big Agnes tent so much, I sold my Tarptent and then bought another one. This time a 2 person tent to replace our aging 23+ year old MEC tent, which is heavy and in bad shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;üö® Big Agnes is a US company ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ, so Canadian üá®üá¶ buyers beware. I bought this in 2024, before the current administration.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tiger Wall UL2 Tent, like the UL1 Tent is a white &#34;solution dyed&#34; tent, which is meant to consume much less water during the production process. Like the UL1, it&#39;s light coming in at 776g when I weighed it on my scales at home, compared to 556g for the one man. That&#39;s light enough that I can use it for backpacking comfortably and took it to New Zealand and multiple trips within British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the UL2 tent, it has doors and vestibule on either side of the tent, allowing occupants to get in and out easily, without disturbing others. The tent is a squish, you have to like the person you are in the tent with, there&#39;s enough room for my and the wife to lie flat on our backs, but not alot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes with pockets on the sides, the top above heads and above the feet. This is enough space to put all your light stuff, leaving the rest to the vestibule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the UL1, it&#39;s semi-free standing, the frame stands on it&#39;s own at the front and sides, but the back requires at least two pegs. So far I&#39;ve put up the tent on wooden pads and it&#39;s been just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s listed as three season tent and since I don&#39;t really camp in the winter, this is just fine for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this on sale and it&#39;s not listed on Big Agnes site anymore, but so far I&#39;m very happy with all the Big Agnes tents I&#39;ve bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total weight as carried - fly and inner sheet, poles, pegs with bag for each: &lt;code&gt;1126g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a Canadian tent supplier, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://durstongear.com/&#34;&gt;Durston&lt;/a&gt;, I haven&#39;t used their tents yet, but starting to see them more on hikes.&lt;/p&gt;
