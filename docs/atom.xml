<title>Fourth Trip - Stein Valley</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-25-stein-valley/"/>
<updated>2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/stein-valley</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite places in BC is the Stein Valley Nlaka’pamux Heritage Park, located by Lytton, BC. It’s special for a couple of reasons. It’s one of the only large unlogged watersheds &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_River&quot;&gt;left in BC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s much warmer than everywhere else, making it ideal for trips when you want to avoid rain, or weather elsewhere is crappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park is big, with one main trail that comes in from the west side of the Fraser River and goes up to the Stein Lake, 50km+ away. This means there is really only one main trail and route in the park with not many options until you get up to the lake. Once you get up the lake passes and trails exist through over to the west to Blowdown Creek etc. This is serious alpine wilderness hiking, which unfortunately I haven’t been able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan was to head up for three days and enjoy the weather. It was also a trial for the West Coast Trail trip as I haven’t back packed in a while… instead using a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-one-heading-up-the-stein&quot;&gt;Day one: heading up the Stein&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry to the Stein means going through Lytton and seeing first hand the devastation of the heat dome last year. The scarred and twisted remains of the centre of the town are just heartbreaking. It’s no exaggeration to say that the town is just gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the Stein you can take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/passenger-travel/water-travel/inland-ferries/lytton-reaction-ferry&quot;&gt;reaction ferry&lt;/a&gt; across the river. Except because of flooding and high snow melt, the ferry was closed. The ramp to get onto the ferry was flooded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7293015309&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two choices left; the rail bridge to the south of Lytton and then an 8km hike up to the park trailhead or the suspension bridge and a ~2km hike. We went for the latter. It looks like this and with a 30km+ wind howling up the Fraser it made an interesting crossing while carrying a large backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3377.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the hike was pretty straightforward, beautiful forests by a raging river. Pictographs carved on rock and lots of camping sites in 28c sunny weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We camped at Devils Staircase campground, which isn’t a staircase and isn’t really hard or devilish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-two-leaving-the-stein&quot;&gt;Day two: leaving the Stein&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan for day two was to head further into the Stein, without our backpacks. We set off heading north and hit a snag. About 1km north of the campground the trail is badly washed out with a gully of death leading right down to the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was seriously steep, seriously sketchy and with a very large penalty if you slipped. I just wasn’t comfortable crossing, I tried and nearly lost it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at that point, we headed back, packed up and reluctantly headed out of the Stein Valley and found a gin an tonic instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7293015342&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out in almost 30c heat, hiking up hills with 40lb+ backpacks and crossing the suspension bridge of doom was enough to wipe us out and we enjoyed our gin and tonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have the ambition to get to the Stein Lake and do the Stein Valley traverse, ideally by crossing over from Blowdown Creek or Lizzie Pass. But not this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A stove</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-25-a-stove/"/>
<updated>2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/a-stove</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the past for camping I’ve used a primus stove like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.primusequipment.com/4a5848/globalassets/catalogs/primus/p3/p351/p35111/p351110/nocolor/351110_essential_trail_stove.jpg?width=680&amp;amp;height=680&amp;amp;mode=BoxPad&amp;amp;bgcolor=fff&amp;amp;quality=80&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It need a pot, a pot handle and a fuel canister. It was better for cooking than some of the other stoves we had, but it has some problems. The flames aren’t very focused, tending to go up the side and it needs a lot of fuel. Fuel is heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my West Coast Trail trip I was determined to be lightweight, that means the only food I took was dehydrated. Fresh water is in abundance on the West Coast Trail and I realised all I was ever doing was boiling water, I don’t need pots or pans. I won’t be cooking for frying anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the Jetboil:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jetboil.johnsonoutdoors.com/sites/johnsonoutdoors-store/files/assets/images/11/1/1114606_primary/1114606_primary.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the Jetboil on the West Coast Trail and loved it for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It boils really fast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The colour coding on the side tells you when its boiled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When its boiled, you don’t need to fiddle with pans or pan handles, the cover allows you to pick it up and pour. It’s just really easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s really light.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s efficient which means you can carry less fuel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for the fuel alone, using the Jetboil meant I could carry one 200g tank of fuel for 5 days of hiking. I would normally carry one &lt;strong&gt;large&lt;/strong&gt; fuel tank, at least 500g+ (haven’t got a full one to weigh). Because the old stove is that inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to carry less and lighter, saving myself carrying multiple items and at least 500g. Over half the people on the trail, if not more, had a Jetboil or similar system.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Watch</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-08-a-watch/"/>
<updated>2022-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/a-watch</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On my racing bike I have a Wahoo Element Bolt and sensors for speed, cadence and power. On my gravel bike I have none of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started doing longer bike trips I realised I didn’t really want all that information. I don’t care about speed, just the time and how long it is to my destination. I want to enjoy the ride. I don’t want to maintain an average speed, or care about my power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trips are for enjoying the ride. So I started using my watch that I use for running and hiking instead to record the trips. The advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The battery lasts for ever&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have to manually look at my wrist to see information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have only the information I care about and nothing else&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A few less gadgets to worry about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coros.com/pace2&quot;&gt;Coros Pace 2&lt;/a&gt; for a while now and love it. It offers “20 Days For Regular Use/30 Hours In Full GPS Mode”. I’m not sure about that, but I haven’t had to charge it on any trip so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controls are two buttons which are easy to operate in the cold, rain or when you are tired. It does what I want, records activity and tells me the information I need. Would highly recommend if you want something simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison my Apple Watch died before I completed a marathon (admittedly a long one up a mountain). The Apple Watch was so complicated it did random stuff and was hard to read and operate. In the cold, rain or when sweaty it would be so hard to use.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>From the Troller to the Raven</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-07-the-raven/"/>
<updated>2022-06-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/the-raven</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1986 Spirit of the West released the album &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripping_Up_the_Stairs&quot;&gt;Tripping up the Stairs&lt;/a&gt;. On that album was a song “The Crawl” on &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/ca/album/the-crawl/1273513877?i=1273513884&quot;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc4eYv2Oyq8&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album details a pub crawl along the North Shore “From the Troller to the Raven with all stops inbetween”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit of the West are no more and at the end of the June the Raven won’t be&lt;/strong&gt;. Multiple people have told me and confirmed by staff that the end of June 2022, the Raven, established 1979 will be closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent.fcxh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/281104355_5315095888535669_5475206090518731323_n.jpg?stp=c0.9.526.274a_dst-jpg_p526x296&amp;amp;_nc_cat=109&amp;amp;ccb=1-7&amp;amp;_nc_sid=340051&amp;amp;_nc_ohc=o03CX2dRhMoAX9VDBF0&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fcxh3-1.fna&amp;amp;oh=00_AT9pm3MQekHwUyYidJ2WPwRYq3w-vccG1lLGpcxpKn12wA&amp;amp;oe=62A458F6&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;q=spirit+of+the+west+the+crawl&quot;&gt;tells the story&lt;/a&gt; of doing a pub crawl from the Troller in Horseshoe Bay all the over to Deep Cove. It mentions a few pubs on the way Park Royal Hotel (closed), The Rusty Gull (open), Square Rigger (open), Queen’s Cross (open). Unfortunately when they get to the Raven, they get the last beer to find they’d lost half their friends and had no money to get a taxi and were walking home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Raven for the first time with my then to be wife on my first visit to Canada - over 29 years ago. Since we now live two blocks away, we tend to go there a lot more than we used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the demise of the Raven is simple greed. The story (as I know it) is that the buildings were taken over by a developer who wanted to turn into condos. The district denied their rezoning plans. The developer has since tripled rents and made the businesses their untenable and one-by-one they’ve all been leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I’m surprised it’s hung on as long as it has. Over the last many years it’s been on its last legs. The beer has gone downhill with less craft beer and become very expensive. The mens toilets have been in various states of disrepair. The food has varied greatly, depending on the chefs - ‘ve gone through plenty. We’ve had food with no cutlery, pizza with metal bits in it, orders messed up. Sometimes poutine that was cold, had plastic in it, was more gravy than anything and so on. With COVID-19 they got a patio to supplement the tiny sunless one by the road - it’s in the parking lot with a fantastic view of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet I still like going to the Raven. It was for me and many an extension of our living rooms. A few weeks ago I was there and saw 5 different groups of friends as people came and went over the evening. No need to get tables or order food - people would just pop in and out. We’d turn up after skiing on Mt Seymour, or biking on the mountain, or kayaking on the ocean in whatever we were wearing and have a drink with friends and no-one would care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it did end up being pretty crap, I will miss the Raven and I think Deep Cove will be worse because of it’s loss.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Third Trip - South Vancouver Island</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-07-south-vancouver-island/"/>
<updated>2022-06-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/south-vancouver-island</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks after my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-second-trip/&quot;&gt;second trip&lt;/a&gt;, it was time to head out on my second trip. I’ve been finding long trips to other countries expensive and hard to organize and I absolutely love British Columbia, so I decided just to spend more time here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cowichancrusher.com/&quot;&gt;Cowichan Crusher&lt;/a&gt; fondo and my course was set. I had a few days spare before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.valleygranfondo.com/&quot;&gt;Valley Fondo&lt;/a&gt;, so didn’t want to go too crazy so instead went to southern Vancouver Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this trip I planned on camping, so went with full gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-deep-cover-to-lake-cowichan&quot;&gt;Day 1: Deep Cover to Lake Cowichan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s warm up for the Fondo by doing a 120km ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7218875101&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out this route is pretty straightforward, avoiding the highway is still a struggle and there’s still choke points where you have to go on the highway north of Cedar, around Ladysmith and near the turn off to Lake Cowichan. At this point I did not know about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvrd.ca/121/Cowichan-Valley-Trail&quot;&gt;Cowichan Valley Trail&lt;/a&gt; which goes from Duncan to Lake Cowichan (and more), if you go this way look it up to avoid roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-cowichan-crusher&quot;&gt;Day 2: Cowichan Crusher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it’s not 100+km, but actually 91km. The route was published on the Friday night and listed over 1760m of elevation, but it was only 1084m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7224179380&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an out and back along the south side of Lake Cowichan. Started off with a bit of road, then wide logging roads and undulating hills. At 40km there was a loop and an insane hill that was really steep. I now have 38-42 gearing and was struggling up it. When I saw people walking at the same speed I was grinding, I eventually swallowed my pride and walked up the last bit. The slope down was even steeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a small event that was fun. I didn’t focus on trying to do amazing, just have some fun and get some gravel in. Of course, it was a race and there were other people so soon my racing instinct took over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to ditch all my gear at the start so didn’t have to lug it around. After a pub lunch with a friend, I went to my campsite and promptly got lost on the way there. So ended up over 118km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7229659808&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got to the campsite, it was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3243.JPG&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I had a bit of a problem. My original plan was to head to Port Renfrew, then Sooke, then back to Lake Cowichan and home by Wednesday with two rest days before the Valley Fondo. There were two problems: the forecast was a lot of rain and I had many sores from two long days (not going to go into details there, suffice to say I was in pain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3-lets-try-going-to-nanaimo&quot;&gt;Day 3: Let’s try going to Nanaimo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on how I felt I reluctantly decided to head home. I felt this was the second time I’d failed at a full Vancouver Island trip, but I wanted my body to recover before the Fondo. But I thought I’d add a twist. Instead of repeating day 1 and doing the highway, I’d try a new route - this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/lake-cowichan-to-nanaimo.png&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This route was spectacular. Soaring mountains, rivers, a road that turned into a logging road and got narrowers. Waterfalls, bear poop, deer and no people. And it went up and up and got smaller and narrower. And steeper. Then it became unrideable. For a long time. Then I was fording streams, then trees were across the road. Then snow, deep snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was before it went really wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3270.JPG&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t ridden my bike for about an hour when I had to make a decision. I was aiming for Nanaimo but had 62km to go and was in snow and getting pretty lost. I had all the gear to camp out, but realised I was unprepared and lacking information on where I was going. It’s well and good camping, but if you are going the wrong way, it could go very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to turn back to Lake Cowichan. Oh but on the way, my tubeless tyre sprung a leak. It was right on the rim, so I think the rim seal (if that’s a thing failed). My repair kit didn’t work so I pulled the tyre off and stuffed in a tube. I only had one spare tube, so was in for a long walk if anything else failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After and 7 hours and 102km 1,259m elevation I got back to a cheap hotel - I needed a hot shower and couldn’t face another 20km+ to the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7229660119&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the warm pub, absolutely wiped and very, very sore I realised I’d missed a turning. That turning would have lead me along a contour line, to the top of a valley and down most of the rest of the way. If I’d carried on going I would have just ended up at top of a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned, research and get good maps for when you go off on logging roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4-lake-cowichan-to-deep-cove-the-boring-way&quot;&gt;Day 4: Lake Cowichan to Deep Cove, the boring way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y’know, following roads and trails that are well established. I did give up at Park Royal and my wife met me, I was wiped. It was still a 115km day so I averaged 100km+ each day and some decent elevation. This is a higher average distance each day than my previous 2 trips and I felt it in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7235049728&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlight was that I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvrd.ca/121/Cowichan-Valley-Trail&quot;&gt;Cowichan Valley Trail&lt;/a&gt; which goes from Lake Cowichan straight into Duncan on a old train line. It’s fast easy and delightful 25km+ of trail that I’d recommend to anyone going that way. I was able to stop in Duncan and pick up some tubes from a local bike shop and then work my way up the coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should carry more than one spare tube.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Definitely research logging roads more and have a better map than just Google maps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I enjoyed camping so much the second night, I wish I’d camped the third night too. I’m bored of hotels and the camping was delightful - at the time my brain was just focused on the first place to crash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My five day trip got shortened by a single day by adding an absolutely epic exploration day by accident, so the trip was pretty good. I don’t feel bad I didn’t get to Nanaimo that way, it was a super exciting and interesting ride. I probably wouldnt do it again that way though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to note that after day 2 I did adjust my seat slightly and that seemed to help, but it did take a couple of days of not riding for things to heal.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Second Trip - Maui</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-second-trip/"/>
<updated>2022-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/second-trip</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks after my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-first-trip/&quot;&gt;first trip&lt;/a&gt; it was time to head out on my second trip. The weather in Vancouver and British Columbia has been unseasonably cold and very frustrating. I wanted to go somewhere warm. There are lots of choices, but all of sudden they all got really expensive. On a whim I found a cheap flight to Maui and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changes-from-my-first-trip&quot;&gt;Changes from my first trip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip had a few differences: I was flying, Maui is really warm, I was never staying anywhere too remote. For this reason I decided not to pack stove, cooking gear, or food. I could live without a good cup of tea for a week. This meant I could remove my frame bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife also pointed out that we had an air mattress that compacted smaller and it fit nicely into my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-panniers/&quot;&gt;new panniers&lt;/a&gt;, meaning I could take one dry bag less as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out camping is really hard to find in Maui. Covid has meant that availability is limited and some have just closed. Here’s the “official” campsites that are left (excluding walk in ones at the top of Haleakala):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/camping-maui.png&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@20.6704429,-156.5285182,10.41z/data=!4m2!10m1!1e1&quot;&gt;Google map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search for campsites on Maui you might find more including state parks that are “good for camping”. You’ll probably also find lots of websites saying you can camp on any beach as long as you have a fishing rod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these places are better than other. The road either side of Lahaina certainly had lots of cars and tents parked up camping on beaches and space for others. So you probably could camp there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m worried enough generally about safety in the US from private property to people with guns that I didn’t feel comfortable doing that based on what some random websites say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I could only get a total of 3 nights camping out of my 7 there. I would have liked more, but it resulted in me getting in the rides I wanted so it’s not so bad. If like me, you want to camp in campsites with facilities and less worries - book early. The resulting trip and locations I stayed in is a result of booking late and trying to avoid the expensive areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-jet-lag-and-assemble-bike&quot;&gt;Day 1: Jet lag and assemble bike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed in Kahului, assembled my bike after a 10:30pm arrival the night before. Most hotels will not store bike boxes or anything overnight, but I did persuade one nice person at the hotel to do it for me (cost a bit in tips).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7110978753/embed/5cd626998d8e95ebbfab65f71002802ad2c22b23&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just a quick shake out ride and then a visit to Walmart to stock up on groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-kahului-to-olowalu&quot;&gt;Day 2: Kahului to Olowalu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first long ride, ending up with campsite and a beach in Olowalu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7121391240/embed/73b811f333e399e90f3795b6eccd0260a273df53&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2052.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely loved this ride. It was gorgeous, very sunny and unbelieveably windy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a big hill coming out of Kahului - its always good to start with the hill and get it out of the way. The village of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kahakuloa,+HI+96793,+USA/@21.0009245,-156.5628451,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!1m2!10m1!1e1!3m4!1s0x7eab2bdab3f68513:0x65c8e7836e04e78!8m2!3d21.0009085!4d-156.55406&quot;&gt;Kahakuloa&lt;/a&gt; marks the transition from the hill - it’s a good place for drinks and banana bread and has spectacular scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next section is all cliff side roads, with fantastic views. At the beginning the road gets very, very narrow but does soon even out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last big transition is around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/D.T.+Fleming+Park/@21.0058175,-156.6468452,14.43z/data=!4m8!1m2!10m1!1e1!3m4!1s0x7eaad5c776457c77:0x9160a3ac662334d7!8m2!3d21.0048584!4d-156.6513703&quot;&gt;DT Fleming Park&lt;/a&gt; where it turns into a highway with a wide shoulder. This is a good place to stop for toilet and water top up before cruising down the highway for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3-olowalu-to-kihei&quot;&gt;Day 3: Olowalu to Kihei&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning I had to make a decision, to try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Olowalu+Beach,+Hawaii+96761,+United+States/Haleakala+Crater,+Hawaii,+USA/@20.7946001,-156.5663247,11z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x7954d620a4d0104d:0x6a34602b0ffa082e!2m2!1d-156.6156274!2d20.8090713!1m5!1m1!1s0x7954c811eeb96541:0x864843523f88c0bc!2m2!1d-156.2535131!2d20.7096826!3e1&quot;&gt;Haleakala Crater&lt;/a&gt; or not. I felt that if I did that, I would absolutely wipe myself out for a couple of days. I was also feeling tired from my previous days ride. Jet lag, or first big exercise since my marathon? Not sure, but I decided to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I took a leisurely ride from Olowalu over to Kihei and had a nice lunch and layabout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7122582736/embed/a5602855ad48294a11ca7d3487719d7ac0222f26&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a flat ride, a good chunk on a busy highway. It also had brutal headwinds that seemed to change and hit me each way. At one point I just gave up riding and walked my bike along the sandy beach instead, tough life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2081.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4-olowalu-to-kahului&quot;&gt;Day 4: Olowalu to Kahului&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big ride was coming up, around Hana and I’d got a hotel back in Kahului to act as the launch point. So I wanted this day to be relatively quiet as well, but I did some of the simple short 20km route yesterday and it wasn’t that fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead I went the long way back to Kahului and reversed my route from the day before. Why the heck not, it was gorgeous. This time I got to stop at some different places on the way and it was just as amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7127821053/embed/4ed5c263f566ddae06399b7d295827833db5688f&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one hill that almost defeated me, called “The Wall” which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7127821053/segments/2959625694434573968&quot;&gt;Strava shows as 15.8%&lt;/a&gt; but feels more like 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2120.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-5-kahului-to-kipahulu&quot;&gt;Day 5: Kahului to Kipahulu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the big one that I’d been looking forward to. I’d been lucky enough to get a campsite a Kipahulu, which is down in Haleakala National Park and half way around east Maui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ❤️ the east side of Maui and was looking forward to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people recommend doing this counter clockwise to avoid tourist traffic heading out to Hana. I did this clockwise because the week before the road near &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kaupo,+HI+96790,+USA/@20.6364922,-156.1309922,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!1m2!10m1!1e1!3m4!1s0x7954ba30cdccfdb5:0xcfee263a13947dc3!8m2!3d20.6364792!4d-156.1222243&quot;&gt;Kaupo&lt;/a&gt; has been washed out and it was impassable. I wanted to ensure that I didn’t cycle counter clockwise, get to Kaupo and then be stuck and have to do a 170km diversion to get to my campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7138008219/embed/5df4b9d3bbf2ef1ee38149d9ec0d8159eb4b726d&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the road until it gets into the “road to Hana” is mostly forgettable and a bit hilly. But then it turns into the most magnificient road ever. It generally flows really nicely and provides comfortable riding with amazing views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tourists are annoying as air conditioned tourists fight to pass each other in their rented SUVs that are far too big for the road and then park at each stop. But they didn’t really get in the way of riding and because they weren’t going fast generally were safe to be around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a wonderful drink and snack stop at Halfway to Hana that kindly filled up all my water bottles. After that you’ve got a long climb, so its good to fill up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tourists run around at Hana, but that’s such a shame. The road down to Kipahulu just gets better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campsite is spectacular and it was basically empty. I had a nice chat with the camp manager and in the past the camp was repeatedly overrun with people that were abusing the site. So they’ve introduced reservations and limited the number of visitors. If you can get a spot it’s worth it, amazing campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2177.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t be a visit to the national park without a hike up to the waterfalls that evening would it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7138007945/embed/8aba46fa2f77129d77cae7ca9f1aad5323ea7d90&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a tiring day, on top of a good ride yesterday and I slept well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-6-kipahulu-to-kahului&quot;&gt;Day 6: Kipahulu to Kahului&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road was open. Funnily enough there were a few rental cars that really shouldn’t have been there either, but that’s always the way. This was another amazing ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road is advertised as four wheel drive only. It’s just fine for a bike. A road bike would probably be ok, just take it easy on the gravelly bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with being close to the sea and beaches. Then it starts to open out and you get to climb. And climb. And climb. Many short steep sections. There is no water for 45km and 1,000 meters and it was getting up to 28c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7138008275/embed/f53b039a252167d21f91c1166f0f405e3de2d203&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This where I started to struggle. But I just rested a few times and enjoyed the remoteness. On one side you had the sea, the other the volcano stretching up with the observatory on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2238.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 45km you get to the Maui Winery and general store that sold water and food. It was a most welcome sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the climbing doesn’t stop until you reach the road that branches off to Haleakala. I didn’t take that and instead cruised dow the hill into Kahului - a nice chance to get my average speed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-7-recovery-and-fly-home&quot;&gt;Day 7: Recovery and fly home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a break, my legs hurt, I was a bit sunburnt (no rain at all) and tired. So I packed my bike and lay on the beach drinking a beer and reading a book for a few hours before heading home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maui isn’t a big island and accomodation is a problem. If I did it again, I’d probably aim for a week in an apartment somewhere like Kihei and just use that as a base. Do west Maui in one day, then spend a day on the beach. Then do the volcano, then a day on the beach. That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winds are really, really strong. I’m glad I left my frame bag at home, it would have provided more surface area for the wind to catch. It was hard enough as it was. Minimize your surface area for the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally the Kihei and Lahaina areas are for tourists. Sandy beaches, no rain, no wind. That’s not the part of Maui that I love. The north shore of west Maui and the east side of Maui are beautiful, wild, remote and just perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Panniers</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-panniers/"/>
<updated>2022-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/panniers</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-first-trip/&quot;&gt;first trip&lt;/a&gt; I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5047-621/Division-Double-Pannier&quot;&gt;these panniers&lt;/a&gt; from MEC that were on my wife’s bike already. There was a few downsides I discovered with these panniers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They aren’t that big.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They aren’t waterproof.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The velcro to hold it down doesn’t always stick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are fine for the trips my wife does, to and from school which takes 10 minutes. They hold up to the worst Vancouver rain for 10 minutes. However 8 hours of rain is another story, they got wet inside. Plus the velcro didn’t stay shut and then I worried about things falling out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ended up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://waterflyshop.com/products/waterfly-bike-pannier-bag&quot;&gt;these panniers&lt;/a&gt;. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bigger, holding 25L according to the spec.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waterproof, although I haven’t had them in 8 hours of rain yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will stay closed thanks to lots of clips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that they are not light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first trip I was able to get all my usual gear in and have space for more. The sidepockets were really helpful for storing phones and tools in. So far, quite happy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Loading it up</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-loading-it-up/"/>
<updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/loading-it-up</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my first trip I needed to loaded up my bike with gear. This is going to be a continual learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my bike full loaded &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-04-24-first-trip/&quot;&gt;on my first trip&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1913.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I didn’t go the usual bike packing way of a large handlebar bag and a behind the seat bag for a few reasons. I found most of the handlebar bags quite restrictive - they take up a lot of space where my hands would normally go. I found that extremely wierd. I’ve ridden with a rack and saddle bags for ages, I find it comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m probably going to be doing more bike touring than bike packing and I’m rarely going to be doing anything too technical and mountain bike like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mec.ca/en/product/6000-588/Nano-X-Hail-Dry-Bag?colour=Zinnia&quot;&gt;MEC 5L dry bags&lt;/a&gt; on the front&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-full-frame-pack/&quot;&gt;middle frame bag from Apidura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-full-frame-pack/&quot;&gt;panniers from MEC&lt;/a&gt; that I stole from my wife’s bag. In there was another MEC dry bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One dry bag that we had lying around on the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dividing everything up logically I was then able to pack this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleeping back and thermals in one of the front dry bags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of my remaining clothes in the other front dry bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleeping mat in the dry bag lying on the top of the rack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One dry bag containing all other things that should stay dry in one pannier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tent in the other pannier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food and all heavy stuff in the middle frame bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remaining stuff (fuel, stove, pots, first aid kit, rope etc) distributed around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seemed to work well, although I made a few changes as I went along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ended up with a few heavy things in the sleeping mat bag. This meant they slid to the back of the bike and caused it to be unstable when standing or cornering. I moved them into the frame bag to be directly over the bottom bracket and that helped a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I found a few things I needed quickly on a cold wet ride: hats, buffs, waterproofs. I quickly redistributed these to places I could get them quickly. The dry bags on the front forks were ideal for just one or two things at the top like this. Quick and easy to get in and out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The panniers had two big flaws, I’m looking for replacements. They aren’t fully waterproof (as the website says). They are fine for short journeys, but 8+hrs of cycling in the rain… no. The velcro can open up when they are overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The frame bag got quickly disorganised because its so big. I need to find a way to organise it better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall once I got the weight distribution better, it worked out well. Until I took a bikepacking.com route and ended up on trails that are just not designed for me with panniers. But it was still fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1935.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The bike was not gonna fit down some of these parts of the trail.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>First trip - Vancouver island</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-first-trip/"/>
<updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/first-trip</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All right, so this first trip is a bit of an odd one in that I wanted to do an overnight or more trip to test everything out. Make sure I liked cycling long distances followed by camping. I wanted to do it locally, but the weather really wasn’t co-operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to get back home for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmovanmarathon.ca/&quot;&gt;my marathon&lt;/a&gt; so I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com&quot;&gt;bikepacking.com&lt;/a&gt; and picked a route that seemed hard (but maybe doable) but also had a good plan B option if it didn’t work out. So I looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com/routes/tree-to-sea-loop-vancouver-island/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and said “why not?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the start of this ride is a multi-day ride. This was an ambitious choice that wasn’t going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-deep-cove-to-sechelt&quot;&gt;Day 1: Deep cove to Sechelt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/6999072231/embed/310cc95eacba23cadd6e7b516255b681f8e049b5&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good ride to the Horseshoe bay ferry. Was nice to see friends on the way. Waiting at the ferry for two hours really cooled me down though 😢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the ferry, there’s those nice hills in Gibsons to contend with, ugh. The rest of the ride to Sechelt is nice and Porpoise Bay is a beautiful campground with a special bike section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1913.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night was cold, there was a wind warning and the wind was blowing across the campground. Because I wasn’t sure, I just grabbed most things and stuck them in the tent with me, leaving the bike to face the cold on it’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also put my food in a dry bag up a tree, because they’ve removed all bear proofing equipment from the cycling campground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-sechelt-to-comox&quot;&gt;Day 2: Sechelt to Comox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7004944540/embed/3458e9256de0f65fa111ca292a8dde7612e8e9c5&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; missing from Strava is the first 10km that I forgot to record from the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It rained overnight, but it wasn’t raining when I first woke up. It was just still windy. That meant I could pack up and get on my way easily enough for the misery that was about to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I passed Sechelt, it got really windy. Multiple times I was being blown sideways as the wind howled off the sea. Then it started to rain. Then I realised how much I hate this part of the highway. From Sechelt to Earls Cove it’s continual short steep climbs and descents. I was continually going from low gear to high gear and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Earls Cove I was cold, wet, battered and tired. I pulled into Earls Cove and had perfect timing straight onto the ferry. Ran upstairs and got a cup of tea to warm up. I was wiped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some nice man offered to drive me to Powell River, but I refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the ferry to Powell River is better, there’s a big uphill, some flats and long downhills. It has nice wide shoulders and is easy to maintain a momentum. There was a two hour wait in a warm waiting room at Powell River for the next ferry as the wind and rain lashed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this point I made a decision to spend a night in Comox at a hotel and not turn right towards Campbell River and try camping. I realised I was not physically or mentally prepared for the original route, up to Cape Scott, and I went for plan B. I chose this route because I knew I could back out easily if I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3-comox-to-parksville&quot;&gt;Day 3: Comox to Parksville&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7009588975/embed/a5d7e73a0f16fdb94184a4c64000b80528449490&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of north, I aimed south and made plans with a friend to stay on Salt Spring island on the way back. Cape Scott and northern Vancouver island will still be there for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a wonderful day, great riding in the sun on the quiet coastal road. The road is spectacular and has little traffic. Qualicum Beach and Parksville were lovely. I was aiming for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com/routes/englishman-river-overnighter/&quot;&gt;Englishman River falls to get in a bit of gravel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That trail was fun, but also got into some pretty narrow and steep singletrack that I wasn’t ready for on my heavily loaded bike, I had to walk a bunch of it. Then got to the top and found that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/englishman_rv/&quot;&gt;campground was closed&lt;/a&gt;. Normally that would be fine, but the water was turned off and it was a long walk to purify some. It was also an extremely mosquito infested campground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7010049726/embed/1e3b9a2da4660ec3bb670f52b7541087b481edb1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I cycled back down to Parksville and stayed at the &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;gt;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/rathtrevor/&quot;&gt;absolutely amazing Rathtrevor Beach&lt;/a&gt; campsite. It was so much better and glad I got the ride up the trails and then stayed at an amazing campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1932.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point after 60km, 90km and 110km days… I was glad I was not heading to Cape Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4-parksville-to-salt-spring&quot;&gt;Day 4: Parksville to Salt Spring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7015146276/embed/cbd203b7c1be7748c0e8a0a7a9b25fa34bcec25e&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another lovely day with sun, getting cloudier towards the end, but little rain. This route had its nice bits and it’s ugly parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Nanoose Bay you have to get on the highway for 5km+. Nanaimo center and south was terrible and there was more highway parts there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you get off the highway, again its a lovely ride through rural Vancouver island. Lovely little communities, few cars and long roads. The ferry from Crofton to Salt Spring is short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really starting to notice how tired my legs were getting at this point. It’s easy to look at 100km on a fast unladen road bike and think of doing that in 3-4 hours. It’s harder on a fully laden bike like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Salt Spring I was greeted by my friend and looked forward to some good chats, beer and food. First I had to cycle up to their house over the ridiculous Salt Spring hills (short and steep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-5-salt-spring-to-deep-cove&quot;&gt;Day 5: Salt Spring to Deep Cove&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7019686713/embed/e71beedf61e735a8243e9ec58cb035d28871a110&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; missing from Strava is the first 11+km that I tried to record, but didn’t. Hey it was 5:00am in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that the best ferry leaves from Fulford Harbour at 6:20am. So I got up at 5am, put the lights on and road across Salt Spring in the dark. At the ferry I had breakfast and sat on the ferry for 2.5 hours as it worked its way via Pender, Maine and Galiano islands over to Tsawwassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route from Tsawwassen to Deep Cove is mostly miserable and riding along River Road is probably the most dangerous and insane thing to do. Just avoid this if you can, but Tsawwassen is extremely hard to get to by bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t rain, at least, but the cycling infrastructure in parts is just so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BC Ferries are awesome for cyclists. Cheap and you don’t need a reservation. They’ve usually got hot food, or some food. They are great, a real bonus if you are exploring this coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 10 day trip around the North of Vancouver island is going to take some planning and some drops of supplies. I was carrying 5 days of food and couldn’t really carry much more. It’s also going to need better weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs and body would have failed me if I’d done that route. Turns out going from almost zero cycling to over 439km (this trip), along with 56km the day before plus a 10km running race… tired me out. I came home and did nothing for two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I recommend this route? I’d avoid doing Salt Spring to Tsawwassen if you can. I wish I’d cycled back to Nanaimo and taken the ferry to Horseshoe Bay. That part of the trip was so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip had almost no gravel and was all paved. That’s ok, but I’d like to get more gravel time in if I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A bike</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-a-bike/"/>
<updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/a-bike</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And of course I can’t go bike packing without a bike. I’ve got a Cervelo S3 disk, which is a fabulous and fast aero carbon fibre bike. But it’s designed for races and sprinting. It’s high geared, can’t take racks, isn’t designed for comfort and I worry when I leave it locked up anywhere. I needed something more practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I headed over &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/&quot;&gt;Landyatchz&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent bike shop on Adanac. They are one of the ones I’d trust in the lower mainland to work on a bike and also build custom frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed was repeated visits over a couple of months to try out their bikes and see what else was available. I really couldn’t find much in other shops either, so two Landyatchz bikes became the favourite, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/shop/gravel/&quot;&gt;aluminium AB1&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/bike/cb-mkii-blue/&quot;&gt;steel cb mkII&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually wanted the latter, but to get one in my size would have meant waiting to August. Thanks supply chain. So I’ve got the aluminium AB1, in the newer colouring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;New gravel touring bike Saturday &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ES9mfCq7A6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ES9mfCq7A6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andy McKay (@andymckay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andymckay/status/1512880146910375940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice gear range, but using SRAM Rival there’s only one gear on the front. Hydraulic disk brakes. Mount points absolutely everywhere. It’s a nice comfortable ride for long days in the saddle. Nice big fat tubeless tyres for off road bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building out the custom build was fun, but again the supply chain problems that are ongoing meant that the choices were rather limited unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways I’m really happy with the bike and some 600km later it’s done the job well, coping with gravel, road and everything I’ve thrown at it. The only two downsides so far is that I do wish the gear ratio went beyond 1:1. With all the bags on, it can be hard work getting up some of the bigger hills. Although I made it up everything that was paved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also would like tyres with less rolling resistance for the road. That’s an easy fix and based on my (perhaps faulty) assumption that I’d be doing more gravel than tarmac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, loading it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The original gearing on this bike was a 42 chainring on the front and a 11-42 on the back. While I was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-second-trip/&quot;&gt;Maui&lt;/a&gt; I really struggled on some steep hills. So I took it to Landyacht and chatted to the mechanics there. Whilst there another person was complaining about the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing long days with lots of gear you need to make life easy on yourself. I changed the front chainring from 42 to 38 before my third trip.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A tracker</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-06-tracker/"/>
<updated>2022-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/tracker</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on travelling in lots of remote places and already do running and hiking in areas not covered by cell phone coverage. It’s pretty easy to get into those areas when you head off the beaten path in North Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided since I’m doing some adventuring alone, it might be time to invest in a tracker. There’s basically two brands out there that I found Garmin and Spot. I’m kinda allergic to Garmin, because the stuff I’ve bought from them has not worked out well in the past and would avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I went for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/spot-gen4&quot;&gt;Gen 4 Spot&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the cheapest and simplest and that’s all I want. It’s got 4 buttons, you press them and its sends a signal to your contacts. It regularly sends your location to its home base. It’s powered by 4 AAA batteries, so easy to keep up to charged on long trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/SPOT/media/Products/SPOT-Gen4/SPOT-Gen4.png?ext=.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty simple and I’ve used it around Vancouver so far with no problems. I’m not sure if there’s going to be an update on this one, unless I get into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/service-plans#spot-gen4-plans&quot;&gt;Spot does have monthly plans&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to the extra costs of activation and a flex plan it quickly works out not much cheaper than an annual plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside is that if you do get into trouble you press the button and wait. There is no way to communicate with anyone. Just press it and hope help comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; the satellites do not cover Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A sleeping bag</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-05-sleeping-bag/"/>
<updated>2022-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/sleeping-bag</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My sleeping bags are optimized for what I started doing in my old age, camping now and again in the summer when its hot. If I barely needed a sleeping bag? That’s the time to go camping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so with the crazy bike packing trips I had in mind. I need something better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By better it needed to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lightweight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pack down small&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Warm and cope with a couple of seasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up with the Spark Ultralight Sleeping Bag from &lt;a href=&quot;https://seatosummit.com/products/spark-ultralight-sleeping-bag-series&quot;&gt;Sea to Summit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2467/2501/products/Spark-Ultralight-Sleeping-Bag-Side-View.jpg?crop=center&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;v=1626820119&amp;amp;width=1500&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its ultralight at 340g, made with ethically sourced down. It covers a couple of seasons of the year. It packs down really small and in my quick test seemed ultra warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve slept out three nights with the bag now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s light, it packs down well but I feel like I’m at the tolerance of warmth for the sleeping bag. It goes down to -2c and is listed as &lt;strong&gt;two seasons&lt;/strong&gt;. I’d hate to get a whole lot colder with this sleeping bag and I’ve had a couple of nights close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also be the combination of the tent, which I’m not sure is ideal for windy weather.&lt;/p&gt;
