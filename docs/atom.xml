<title>Reporting a driver</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2021-12-04-reporting-a-driver/"/>
<updated>2021-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/reporting-a-driver</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A month or so ago I was a traffic light waiting to turn left. The car in front waited as well. Before the light turned green, it decided to do a left turn through a red light across multiple lanes of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This car was not turning left “late”. It made a &lt;strong&gt;deliberate and calculated decision to turn left on red light&lt;/strong&gt;. A few moments later the light would turn green allowing the opposing traffic to come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/turning-left.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit the button on my Tesla and got a full recording on video of the car doing this. When I got home I could see I got the license plate nice and clearly. So at this point I thought, let’s see what it’s like to report a driver… and here’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also&lt;/strong&gt; this driver has an “N” plate and is a new driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finding-where-to-report&quot;&gt;Finding where to report&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icbc.com/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;ICBC&lt;/a&gt; isn’t interested. There is nothing on their website to report this. They are only interested when someone crashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident was on Boundary Rd which is the border between Vancouver and Burnaby. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.vancouver.ca/PoliceCitizenReporting_net/&quot;&gt;Vancouver police site&lt;/a&gt; is not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/vancouver-police.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the juristiction for Boundary Rd. is actually the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=2114&amp;amp;languageId=1&amp;amp;contentId=64642&quot;&gt;Burnaby RCMP&lt;/a&gt;, so I went to their website. The Burnaby RCMP website let’s you report something online, yes there’s an option for “Someone was driving poorly”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you have “video surveillance” you can’t report it online. That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/burnaby-rcmp-nope.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have to phone them. I phoned their non-emergency line and waited over an hour and half. Gave the details and was told I’d be called back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-evidence-to-the-police&quot;&gt;Getting evidence to the police&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An officer phoned me back and said they’d need to see the video and I had to “drop it off”. Alright, if that’s what you want me to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I copy the video to a cheap old USB stick, because that’s the best idea I’ve got and have to drive over to Burnaby RCMP detachment (45 min return drive). They take my USB stick and say that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;follow-up&quot;&gt;Follow up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month later I’ve heard nothing from anyone. I phoned Burnaby RCMP and they say I have to contact the constable to get my USB stick back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email from the Burnaby RCMP doesn’t work (perhaps I wrote it down wrong), but if I can figure this out then I’ll have to drive back to Burnaby and pick it up (another 45 min return drive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They won’t tell me if anything happened, if any penalties were assessed because of privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cost me a USB stick and at least three hours. If I’m able to get my USB stick back, it will be closer to four hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fastest and easiest way to get satisfaction is to just post the video on social media&lt;/strong&gt;. Next time I’ll just do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a just huge pile of dis-incentives in this system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it’s hard to find where to report a driver&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the institutions make it hard to report it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they make you go out of your way in terms of time and money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there’s no feedback so you don’t know what qualifies for reporting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you don’t know if you did any good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;no incentive to report a dangerous driver&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, there are &lt;strong&gt;only dis-incentives to report dangerous drivers&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s pointless, costs you time and money, and you have no idea if anything happens as result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-we-could-improve&quot;&gt;What we could improve&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more cars have dashcams and more people have cars and cameras. We have more opportunity to make our roads safer than ever before, but we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some suggestions…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-it-easy-to-report&quot;&gt;Make it easy to report&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only place that seemed to care about reporting this was the Burnaby RCMP. The Vancouver police and ICBC didn’t allow anything on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be easy to do on a website, answer a few questions, and then upload a video. It should take 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having to “drop off a video” these days is ridiculous. Videos can be uploaded to social media or another number of places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;provide-feedback&quot;&gt;Provide feedback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two crucial pieces of feedback that people need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One:&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing that drivers are being held accountable and people reporting them helps. This makes people report dangerous driving. Reports can be aggregate to avoid identifying individual drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two:&lt;/strong&gt; Feedback such as “that’s not dangerous driving and an offence” and “your video was inadmissable because of x” would help people figure out when to actually submit videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-someone-care&quot;&gt;Have someone care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICBC is “a provincial crown corporation providing​ auto insurance, driver licensing, vehicle registration, road safety, and other products and services” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/company-info/Pages/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it wants to take part in &lt;strong&gt;road safety&lt;/strong&gt; do you think it should care or help with this? It could collate and help forward information onto the appropriate law enforcement agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into this knowing that likely nothing would happen. But I was dispirited how rarely it would happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also made me realize how even more ridiculous the “license and register cyclists” argument is. We can’t even hold drivers of 2 ton machines that kill people and the planet responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cycling moments of terror</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2021-10-04-moments-of-terror/"/>
<updated>2021-10-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/moments-of-terror</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We know that British Columbia, by way of the Motor Vehicle Act, is not a province that supports cycling. Generally cycling here is one that involves moments of terror and then real terror depending upon the lack of infrastructure you face cycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;britannia-beach&quot;&gt;Britannia Beach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cycle the sea to sky you will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@49.636184,-123.2112272,3a,75y,40.89h,73.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0EcERbAEh5IO4b8YiZ47uQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;find this on the road out of Britannia Beach&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where the shoulder for cycling goes instantly with &lt;strong&gt;no signs&lt;/strong&gt; or warning down to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/britannia-beach.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyclists are forced straight out into traffic. There’s no signs, no warning to cyclists or drivers. It’s on a right hand bend, so you are forced to cycle around the bend in the lane, where cars are doing 90 km/h. That means cars can’t actually see you as they go around the bend. Sheer terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;porteau-cove&quot;&gt;Porteau Cove&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Porteau Cove there are lots of signs and warning to both cyclists and drivers this is happening. Its a less sharp right hand bend and I normally hit this at 40km/h+ on a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/porteau-cove.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does “Share the road” mean? Well because BC has no passing distance, I was cycling through this section at 40km/h a feet or two into the lane when a bus decided to pass me at 80km/h+. &lt;strong&gt;I was able to reach out my left arm and hit the bus&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s how close it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seymour-parkway&quot;&gt;Seymour Parkway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about the Seymour Parkway. There’s a bike lane, great. Highlighted with red arrow (and yes that’s a truck crossing it). Before that there’s no bike lane because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there’s a right turn lane for cars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a lump of concrete with some signs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a bus stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/seymour-parkway-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/seymour-parkway-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a designated ICBC bike route, that ICBC wants to ride to avoid anatagonising drivers (yes, it’s all cyclists fault)… and again you have to swerve out into the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many moments of terror cycling because cycling infrastructure when it does occur is on a block by block basis and done with the minimal amount of cost and inconvenience to drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cycling to Deep Cove</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2021-06-06-cycling-to-deep-cove/"/>
<updated>2021-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/cycling-to-deep-cove</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week ICBC tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you’re out cycling this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoByBikeBC?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#GoByBikeBC&lt;/a&gt; week, please use designated bike routes whenever possible – they’re safer &amp;amp; reduce conflicts with vehicle traffic. Check your municipality’s website for designated bike routes or go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TransLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TransLink&lt;/a&gt; for Metro Vancouver cycling maps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tZt9wA5JXy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tZt9wA5JXy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; ICBC (@icbc) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/icbc/status/1400873754608209926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tweet is problematic for so many reasons and continues ICBC unhelpful approach,  victim blaming cyclist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this week the District of North Vancouver tweeted out that they are adding a bike valet to Deep Cove:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Construction is underway in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeepCove?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DeepCove&lt;/a&gt;, so this weekend, take advantage of the free bike valet in Panorama Park and leave your car at home. The bike valet operates from 10am- 5pm on Saturdays, Sundays, and statutory holidays. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bihHZG0rlw&quot;&gt;https://t.co/bihHZG0rlw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zNylpVbcWh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zNylpVbcWh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; District of North Vancouver (@NVanDistrict) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NVanDistrict/status/1400861567168745472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what they won’t do, is make cycling to Deep Cove any safer. This continues a clear lack of co-ordination and planning with a patchwork of cycling improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume you coming to Deep Cove from somewhere around Ironworkers Memorial Bridge. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.translink.ca/-/media/translink/documents/rider-guide/cycling/local-area-maps/pack_tl-cyclemaps_northshore.pdf&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; for “designated cycling routes” is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.translink.ca/rider-guide/cycling-in-metro-vancouver#metro-vancouver-cycling-maps&quot;&gt;TransLink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two routes: Mount Seymour Parkway and Dollarton Highway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/designated-bike-routes.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Seymour Parkway&lt;/strong&gt; has two lanes of traffic each way travelling at 60km. There are areas with parked cars (dooring zone) and painted to seperate you from traffic. Until you get to Mt Seymour Road and then it ends, there is no more “designated cycling routes”. Most cyclists given the choice avoid this road because it’s dangerous and scary to be that close to vehicles moving that fast. It also has big hills at the start and end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollarton Highway&lt;/strong&gt; varies between two lanes and one lane of traffic travelling at 50km or 40km. There is one section of the highway that is not even designated as a cycling route. As a “designated cycling route” there is no continuous paint line, instead there are drawings of bicycles on the road and many “share the road” signs. Most cyclists chose this because it’s less hilly and scary than Mount Seymour Parkway. There are large parts of this route with parked cars (dooring zone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember&lt;/strong&gt; there is no safe designated passing distance in the Motor Vehicle Act, so it’s up to car drivers to decide their passing distance. If you ride a bike a lot, you’ll know what this means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, both those routes are designated as &lt;strong&gt;Comfortable for Few&lt;/strong&gt; by Translink, because there is no seperation from the traffic. Check out this graphic for that means according to TransLinks own website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/comfortable-for-few.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging people to cycle to Deep Cove by providing a bike valet is a commendable achievement. But &lt;strong&gt;without safe cycling infrastructure to get you to the bike valet&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s only going to result injury, accidents and worse. Translink website shows that’s it &lt;strong&gt;not possible to get all the way there on a designated bike route&lt;/strong&gt; and if you do, &lt;strong&gt;it’s only “comfortable for few”&lt;/strong&gt;. So what are we meant to do ICBC and the District of North Van?&lt;/p&gt;

<title>My fifth Gran Fondo</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2019-09-20-fifth-fondo/"/>
<updated>2019-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/fifth-fondo</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A bit ago was my fifth Gran Frondo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2018-09-09-fourth-fondo/&quot;&gt;the last&lt;/a&gt; was in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I dropped 25 minutes off my time and that made me really happy. This year my goal was 4 hours. This was just an aribtrary number, but it was also based on an attempt to qualify for the 2020 version of this race which is a UCI World Cup Event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to May I was almost continually running with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2344462557/overview&quot;&gt;BMO Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt; in May which I did in 2h 08m. In March, April and May I was running up to average of 40km a week.  I guess I was kind excited by that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;2:08:42 for my first half marathon - woot! Next year the full deal. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uwBDROsGSD&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uwBDROsGSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Destroy all cars (@andymckay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andymckay/status/1125131691234811904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 5, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I focused a lot on running this year, my riding patterns changed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2017 (up to Fondo)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2018 (up to Fondo)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2019 (up to Fondo)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;243h&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;232h 16m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;165h 51m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Distance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,050km&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,279km&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,889km&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rides&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;198&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;136&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in 2019, I spent less time on the bike. In fact I haven’t spent this little time on a bike since &lt;strong&gt;2015&lt;/strong&gt;, which was my first year. After May I ran less frequently, but carried on running, varying between 0 (on bad weeks) to 30km (on good weeks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2018-05-27-mt-seymour/&quot;&gt;Mount Seymour&lt;/a&gt; at least 9 times (most yet) and broke my own personal record 4 times. I managed quite a few 100km plus rides: including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2532536358&quot;&gt;160km Penticton Gran Fondo&lt;/a&gt; race, the challenge route of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2648420747&quot;&gt;Ride to Conquer Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a ride up to Whistler, and a couple of trips to Golden Ears park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this year I got a little more organised with my training. This is taped to my bedroom wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mckay.pub/files/ED57AcSVUAEa5VC.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I rode with Steed group 2 a few times, that’s the second fastest group and sometimes they go at a hell of a pace. Last year I stepped up from group 4 to group 3. Next year I aim to have group 2 as my default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the race came and as usual I spent a few days before hand excited and not sleeping too well. Yet again I hadn’t lost enough weight and I really doubted if the 4 hour figure was reasonable. Just thinking through what I did last year to get to 4:19 seemed daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I started in the 4 to 4.5 corral which is essential to getting in with a good group. The first 30km was marred by several large and nasty looking crashes. I focused on going fast up to Squamish but needed to save something for later. As I passed my marker in Squamish I thought I was behind but honestly I didn’t feel like I’d pushed myself too hard and felt fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to me, I’d set personal records all the way and crushed it. My average was over 32km/h an hour at that point. To get close to 4 hours, my goal was to not let it drop below 30km/h. This year I couldn’t find good draughts in Squamish, the people were going too slow so I kept pulling out… and as a result pulled an awful lot of people through Squamish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I piled up the hills and again failed to find good draughts, despite thinking strategically and doing my best to line them up in the right places. About 25-30km out from Whistler I bonked again and realised I hadn’t been eating right. About 15km I was struggling hard and failing to keep up. My average km kept dropping and dropping. I was just pissed off and couldn’t understand why I couldn’t go faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2688389229&quot;&gt;I ended up crossing at 4h 16m&lt;/a&gt;. That’s 3 minutes faster - I was happy and sort of pissed off that I wasn’t faster. It’s my fastest ever time, I’ve been faster every year so I’ll take that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2688389229/embed/a40d29d1cc807aa0cb7d36fb4cb6830e9eca7f4c&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I guess I was pretty happy with it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Fuck yeah! Fastest time yet 4:16 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DSdOEe33NG&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DSdOEe33NG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Destroy all cars (@andymckay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andymckay/status/1170415223066386432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 7, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not qualify for the World Cup race for next year, but I’ve signed up again to do the normal race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve signed up again and I’m going to crush 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Checking in with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/&quot;&gt;five month goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Holy crap it’s been this long.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lost a couple of pounds and finally got back on track with my diet. Not as good as it could be, but getting better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still stuggle with eating too much after exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’m doing a lot of exercise and I’m back cycling now, yay! Did 127 km bike ride followed by an 80 km bike ride this weekend for example. Yeah I was tired.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Still running a couple of days a week around 5km ish. Need to bring that back up to 8 and 10km and still keep cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven’t been to the gym in ages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I’ve got a plan for cycling through to the Fondo. Damn holidays keep getting in the way though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

<title>Create Issue Extension</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2019-05-14-create-issue/"/>
<updated>2019-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/create-issue</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I needed to find a better way to keep track of my to-do lists. I’ve tried a few tools, but after a while always forget about them and don’t keep them up to date. A to-do list is only any good if you add stuff to it and look at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend 95% my time in about 5 places these days: Google Calendar, Google Docs, Gmail, Slack and Github. I spend a lot of time on the latter, GitHub. So, of course, to super charge my to-do list I went for a quick browser extension - cue colleagues who laugh and say “of course you did” when I mention this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andymckay/create-issue&quot;&gt;Create issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/create-github-issue/&quot;&gt;stupid simple Firefox Extension&lt;/a&gt; that lets you highlight a peice of text on a page, then right click to create an issue. It creates the issue in a repository defined on the config page using a personal access token. That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this is that everything is a web page. Emails. Slack messages. Docs. All you do is highlight some text then right click and it creates an issue with the selected text and a URL to the item. Key to this is that’s it &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt; to create a simple issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74699/53767875-fac37300-3e8b-11e9-8401-650d0a317f3a.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this I’ve setup a private repo (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.blog/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/&quot;&gt;those are free now&lt;/a&gt;). Thanks to all the integrations with GitHub issues, I get a bunch of stuff for free:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;automatic links on other issues and PRs across GitHub back to my to-do item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;notifications in email and Slack&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace/stale&quot;&gt;stale&lt;/a&gt; to automatically clean my list&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/probot/reminders&quot;&gt;reminders&lt;/a&gt; to remind me of me of things at set times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve used this more than any to-do list system I’ve used in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>2019 Goals - Four months check in</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2019-05-13-four-months-in/"/>

<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Checking in with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/&quot;&gt;four month goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lost a couple of pounds but keep going up and down. Still struggling with this. My diet is still not good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diet has fallen completely and this is where I need to get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running was amazing in April. We continually did longer and longer runs 14km, 16km, 18km, 19km, 21km runs. Only once when I decided to run the last 3km at 5:30 min/km pace did I feel totally exhausted after.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I haven’t been to the gym in ages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;But most of all…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2344462557&quot;&gt;a half marathon&lt;/a&gt;! I didn’t die! I didn’t walk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously most of the half marathon was actually quite fun. It started out in Queen Elizabeth park and headed downtown, around Stanley Park and into downtown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until about 17km I was doing great with a sub 6 min/km pace, but I hit the proverbial wall in the last few km. The run uphill towards the finish (at 5:27 min/km pace I’ll add) was brutal. I ended up starting off with friends, but then running the whole thing by myself, which was probably the best thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty proud of that one and I’ll have to beat my 2 h 8 min time next year.&lt;/p&gt;

<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Checking in with my &lt;a href=&quot;httsp://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/&quot;&gt;two month goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lost a couple of pounds but keep going up and down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diet has fallen completely and this is where I need to get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running has improved again. The training runs are getting longer and longer. I did my longest run 11.2km and broke 30km a week twice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I thought I did the West Van Run in 29 minutes last year. Turns out it was over 30 minutes. This year I came in 27.29, which puts me at a solid 5:30 pace. Faster than last time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gym work has picked up a little, mostly a chance to do long slow bike rides and focus on keeping my heart in zone 1.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haven’t had alcohol since 2018 even though I’ve been to some pubs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to do, especially on the weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>2019 Goals - One month check in</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2019-02-01-one-month-in/"/>

<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Checking in with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/&quot;&gt;one month goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lost 12 pounds. Although I did go as much as 15 pounds down, only to come back up again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Diet was mostly Keto for a while, but I’ve slipped into some carbs for running and sometimes have too many carbs. That’s probably caused the lack of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Running has dramatically improved. At the beginning of the month I was feeling down because I was going slowly. This last week I completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2107454561&quot;&gt;7.1k at a sub 6km/minute pace&lt;/a&gt; and my training runs are getting faster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Signed up for the West Van Run in March, want to beat my time on that from last year - 29 minutes - significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Set a goal of doing a 10k in under an hour - that’s 5 minutes to chop off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Gym work has dropped off significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Haven’t had alcohol since 2018 even though I’ve been to some pubs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to do.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>2019 Goals</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2018-12-28-goals/"/>
<updated>2018-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/goals</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My goal&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m going to beat last years time of 4:19 and do the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rbcgranfondo.com/whistler/&quot;&gt;Whistler Gran Fondo&lt;/a&gt; in September 2019 in 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That seems absurdly ridiculous on the face of it, but the fact that I was able to shave off 23 minutes this year was nothing short of miraculous to me. So let’s try shaving off another 19 minutes. How am I going to do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get serious about losing weight again. I’ve done it in the past and then I revert. This year I’m aiming for a race weight of 160 lbs. In the past I’ve been around 180 lbs by the time I do the Gran Fondo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Improve my watts per kg. The amount of power you can output is important so I’ve got to lose weight without losing muscle. I did an estimated 236w power last Fondo, if I can do the some power output and weigh less I’ll push up my time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actual things I’m going to do to meet these goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do a half marathon. I’m in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmovanmarathon.ca/&quot;&gt;BMO Half&lt;/a&gt; in May. I’ve done 4 10k races so far and I found the last one a bit slow and painful. I need to get comfortable at doing 5k every day and a 10k regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cycle regularly in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://steedcycles.com/ride-clubs/&quot;&gt;Steed group 2&lt;/a&gt;. That’s the faster group than I normally ride in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Complete the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/segments/612178?filter=current_year&quot;&gt;Seymour Hill Climb&lt;/a&gt; in under 1 hour. My top time is 1:15:34 and according to Strava I’m 4924 / 6151. There’s room for improvement there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do lots of work at the gym to work on my core, leg and back muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can totally do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: I might just say screw it and not do this. It’s my life.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Car Tracking</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2018-12-15-car-tracking/"/>
<updated>2018-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/car-tracking</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week I recieved and email from the Clean Energy Vehicle program. They’d like us to install a device in our Tesla that tracks us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By understanding when and where EVs charge to how much energy is consumed, you can help pave the way for future drivers by ensuring that the power system is ready for a plug-in future.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program details &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fleetcarma.com/chargebc/&quot;&gt;are here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“GPS information is collected, but not shared at the individual level. The data is collected and stored but no one outside of FleetCarma will see an individual’s location data.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright so who’s FleetCarma? Let’s look into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fleetcarma.com/chargebc/terms/&quot;&gt;the terms&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Data Collected by the C2 Device and Privacy…  drive start date and time, duration of trip, trip distance… GPS coordinates of the drive,”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the specific exclusion of GPS coordinates when driving, an anonymized subset of the data outlined above may be shared with the Province and BC Hydro and other third party suppliers”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“GPS coordinates during driving will not be shared with any Program partners or third party suppliers except in both anonymous and aggregate form to inhibit extraction of any individual driving behaviour.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure who those Program partners or third party suppliers are but GeoTab uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sVygLN02w2xNovFY4q5vw-oAzfYxCd7WLhyToElgDbs/pub&quot;&gt;some sub-processors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FletCarma will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fleetcarma.com/privacy/&quot;&gt;share your information&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To affiliated entities of CrossChasm Technologies Inc., including wholly owned subsidiaries” (Whomever that is)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we’re legally required to provide data, such as in response to a subpoena in a civil lawsuit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice to note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You may also request that your Personal Information be deleted. FleetCarma will promptly respond to your request within 30 days”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I can surmise that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FleetCarma will know all the trips I make in the car.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FleetCarma be subpoenad to give up that information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;FleetCarma can be hacked to give up all that information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally this would be a simple, hell no. But I care greatly about electric cars and the infrastructure and this has put me in a bind. The privacy problem here is one that I simply can’t get around.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>BC going electric</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2018-11-20-bc-going-electric/"/>
<updated>2018-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/bc-going-electric</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today the BC Government announced that they will be planning to introduce legislation that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;All new cars and trucks sold in B.C. in the year 2040 will have to be zero-emission vehicles&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/every-new-car-sold-in-2040-will-be-zero-emission-b-c-government-says-1.4913679&quot;&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m unreasonably interested and excited by this. There is a simple fact that we need to do this and car companies will not do it, they are too &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedrive.com/news/24142/bmw-expects-85-percent-of-its-cars-will-keep-traditional-combustion-engines-in-2030&quot;&gt;invested in the existing carbon economy&lt;/a&gt;. My first thought is that 2040 is way too far off, but this really isn’t a simple change and the political and societal desire to change is not strong enough to force a sudden change yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other jurisdictions are making similar noises, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://qz.com/1341155/nine-countries-say-they-will-ban-internal-combustion-engines-none-have-a-law-to-do-so/&quot;&gt;haven’t introduced legislation yet&lt;/a&gt;. Two that talk about it more are the UK and California. There are some interesting questions in BC :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BC is big. Twice the size of California and over four times the size of the UK. It’s full of a lot of nothing. You can go long ways without encountering anything. This problem is common to most of Canada, but the current range of electric vehicles is more obvious when its 400km to the next charging station.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;BC gets &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_temperatures_in_Canada&quot;&gt;really cold up north&lt;/a&gt;. Colder than California or the UK. This affects &lt;a href=&quot;https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/cold-weather-driving.64591/&quot;&gt;electric batteries and charging&lt;/a&gt;. Again this problem affects all of Canada.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_C_dam&quot;&gt;Site C isn’t perfect&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ll need the electricity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remind me why we should have a pipeline to ship oil from Alberta out again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I am focusing on electric vehicles here, because that’s the majority of non oil burning cars out there. Notably Vancouver has the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/hydrogen-fuel-pump-opens-in-vancouver-1.4709016&quot;&gt;first hydrogen fuel station&lt;/a&gt; in Canada. We might need hydrogen in other parts of BC, or perhaps there will be another answer by then, but for the moment it looks like we are looking at an electric future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;a href=&quot;/2018-07-25-tesla/&quot;&gt;Tesla is pretty amazing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I hope this legislation happens and if so it sets us down an interesting path. A slow one, but there are some real problems to solve on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>So done with the NFL</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2018-11-15-done-with-the-nfl/"/>
<updated>2018-11-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub.ca/done-with-the-nfl</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been an NFL for fan for a long time. It started before university when I rebelled against any sport that was vaguely popular at school (and seemed absolutely terrible). For no other reason than they did well at the time, I became a Washington Redskins fan (yes I’m old).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a football team at university, I was involved in it. I even heard Chuck Noll speak once. If there was a Redskins game on TV, I would go up to the local pub in my jersey and watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years I’ve become pretty upset with what the NFL has become. Well the NFL has always been this way - but I didn’t care. I enjoyed the game, the drama, the strategy, the rivalies, and I ignored or excused away all the problems for my own enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I realised that I couldn’t keep doing this. The problems just kept increasing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Redskins is a terrible name for a team and is pretty much condemned as a racist. They need to change it, but they won’t because the Redskins make lots of money for Daniel Synder (Redskins owner).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The treatment of players and the problems with concussions has been terrible. The NFL has swept it under the rug for so long. Yes they’ve introduced changes, but tried to balance the fundamental problems that constant head contact is part of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cheerleaders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colin Kapernick.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The owners siding with Trump over their players.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The NFL is technically taxed as a charity so it isn’t a good corporate citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The league owners hold regularly hold cities and tax payers to ransom over stadiums.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So many adverts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Snyder is one such business person and I don’t want to support him. I want to be proud of the thing I spend so much time following and I want to be a good example to my daughters. The only way I know how to do that is stop watching the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s now over half way through the season, I haven’t watched a game, I don’t really know what’s going. I’ve unsubscribed from all the football blogs, podcasts and tweets. They were showing the standings on the TV in a pub and it showed that the Redskins are doing quite well this year after years of being crap. But whatever, I don’t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps something will change to make me go back, but its not the game being boring, it’s the sides that the NFL takes. Somethings got to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Footnote:&lt;/b&gt; with the exception of the Green Bay Packers who are the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team. Have no cheerleaders, play in all kinds of weather and are just awesome. They haven’t solved the problem about treating their players properly or being in a league with other terrible people though.&lt;/p&gt;
