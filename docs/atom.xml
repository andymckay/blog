<title>Fifth trip - West Coast Trail</title>

<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/SCO-WCT&quot;&gt;West Coast Trail&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular hiking trips in the world and has for many years been a rite of passage for many people in BC. In June I noticed that a spot was available - they normally all get booked for the year as soon as the reservations open in January - and took it. Heading from the south to the north on June 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of spending the weeks cycling or running I focused on hiking with a back pack, doing my usual local trails with varying weights of backpacks and also doing the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-06-25-stein-valley/&quot;&gt;Stein Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd read lots of posts about the trail and the toll the 75km takes on people. Over 100 people are year are evacuated usually due to hypothermia or injuries from slipping. The weeks leading up to the trip were mostly full of anxiety‚Ä¶ would I be fit enough, would I have the right gear and so on. I went full on as &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-06-25-packing-light/&quot;&gt;light as possible&lt;/a&gt;, was this a bad move? We‚Äôd find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üëâ &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcweb.azureedge.net/-/media/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/WET4/visit/PDF/2019-WCT-Map_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;Map of the trail as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry, this is a long one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-there&quot;&gt;Getting there&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me leaving a car at Port Renfrew or Bamfield wasn‚Äôt option. Port Renfrew has paved access, Bamfield is accessible only by logging road. The two main options are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ladyrosemarine.com/schedule-rates&quot;&gt;Bamfield ferry to Port Alberni&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trailbus.com/&quot;&gt;Trail Bus&lt;/a&gt;. I took the bus from Victoria to the start and they picked me up at Bamfield and took me back to Nanaimo. The bus was cool, but its a bus on logging roads, you‚Äôll get a comfier ride on the ferry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;direction&quot;&gt;Direction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a note that I had no choice in direction. The two main ways are north to south or south to north. Options from Nitinaht are available, which is basically in the middle. The hardest parts of the trail are by far the sections from Walbran Creek south. Specifically the section to the west of Camper Bay and east of Camper Bay to Gordon River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing south üëâ north, you do the hardest parts first. If you are doing north üëâ south, you will do the hardest parts last. Some say, its better to save the hardest part to last since you will have eaten food and have a lighter pack. I was happy I did south to north and got the tough stuff done while fresh, it just got easier every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-one-gordon-river-to-camper-bay&quot;&gt;Day one: Gordon River to Camper Bay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;13.35km in 5h 33min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus deposited us at the entrance to the park. A bunch of nervous hikers all checking out each others backpacks and asking how long they‚Äôll take and so on. A really nice person gave us an orientation and talked us through the video. For the route you‚Äôll need to keep a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcweb.azureedge.net/-/media/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/WET4/visit/PDF/2019-WCT-Map_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;map on hand&lt;/a&gt; and have a list of the tide times. A lot of trail is on the beach and you‚Äôll need to know what the tide is (they give you this, don‚Äôt lose it). This means you will also need a device that tells you the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the chatter was about how small my backpack and was how light it was. At this point I wasn‚Äôt quite sure if I was just completely stupid for going so small and light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park ranger told us that the first campsite Thrasher takes most people 4 hours to get to - it‚Äôs only 5km away. The next campsite Camper Bay takes another 4 hours to get to. They then got into details about going from Thrasher to Camper Bay by see - it involves a boulder field that takes about 3 hours and then dangerous cliffs and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this seemed to be an exercise in caution, understanding the map and tides. I imagine that the rangers have to deal with people of all abilities on this trail and they have to deal with pulling people out when it goes wrong, a tough job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the start you have to take a ferry and at about 10:30am I was off, on the West Coast Trail, solo  - the most dangerous way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the river you are faced with a vertical ladder to scale. The first of many and telling of what is to come:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020717.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;This is the start. Get used to it.&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me 2 and a bit hours to get to the junction to Thrashers. I was hiking at my usual comfortable speed I was doing in North Vancouver and overtaking people who started on the 8am ferry. It felt comfortable for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362981527&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I would end up at Thrashers at 1pm ish and have an entire day to wait for tides to go around the coast. And I‚Äôd have to wait in the morning for the tides again. That would get me to Campers on day 2. I‚Äôm not good at waiting around and the boulder field and only part of the map marked ‚ÄúVery dangerous‚Äù didn‚Äôt appeal. Plus, I really wanted to ensure I finished on schedule‚Ä¶ the day after the West Coast Trail is my daughters graduation, I promised not to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pushed on to Camper Bay and got there in two and a bit hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020722.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;So many broken bridges and boardwalks. This coast is tough on infrastructure.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail Gordon River to Thrashers felt like a hike on the more remote North Vancouver trails (eg: Three chop, upper lynn loop etc). Just throw in a bunch of ladders. Thrashers to Camper Bay was a muddy hell hole of broken boardwalks, mud, deep mud, slippy everything and mud. Parts of this were not that much fun. People I chatted to later said the boulder field on the coast wasn‚Äôt fun either so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I took the cable car across and camped at Camper Bay for the night. Met a nice group from Alberta who let me share their camp fire. Mostly we spoke about how I managed to do it so fast, when some of their group took over 6 hours to get to Thrashers ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ. The advantage of doing this kind of trail regularly and having a super light backpack I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-two-camper-bay-to-bonilla-point&quot;&gt;Day two: Camper Bay to Bonilla Point&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16.8km in 7h 24min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the sun rose, I staggered out of bed, made my tea and oats and packed up. First one out on the trail up north. For this day there were multiple places I could camp, it was more about where I wanted to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362981573&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section out of Camper Bay continued the trend of being broken boardwalks, mud, bog, ladders, rivers, bridges, ladders, more ladders, mud and so on. Did I mention mud? There‚Äôs a lot of that. When you get to Walbran Creek, it mud comes to and end you was able to exit from the forest onto the beach for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020736.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;So many ladders and its hard to get a feel of how steep they are from these pictures.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still felt good at this point, strong and powering through things. I will admit, I did find some of the ladders a bit scary at times. Heights aren‚Äôt my thing and having a backpack and poles etc makes it harder. Doing some of those in pouring rain, with heavy backpacks must be hard. Camper Bay to Walbran is rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020754.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Coming out of the forest onto the beach felt pretty good.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had lunch at Walbran Creek and tried to cross - silly idea. I got my feet and gaiters totally drenched and was only half way across when it got really deep. So I back tracked and went across the creek using the cable car higher up. But that gave me the excuse to have a cup of tea, change socks and dry things out a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that it was gorgeous beach walking for a while. I stopped at Bonilla Point to camp because its cute, has a waterfall and was deserted. And it stayed that way, being the only person there all night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind, not all beach walking is easy. The sand is at an angle and often very soft so you slip a lot. You‚Äôll also be climbing over rocks, seaweed, rock shelves and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night the weather closed it and we got wet west coast mist for many hours, so I hid in the tent most of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-three-bonilla-point-to-tsusiat-falls&quot;&gt;Day three: Bonilla Point to Tsusiat Falls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;25.24km in 9h 52min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsusiat Falls is one of the most popular camping sites on the West Coast Trail. It marks a destination for hikers from the north. For them its the last site before a long trek to Cribbs through an area that‚Äôs low in water and has no formal campsites. Similarly from the south, once you go past Cribbs there isn‚Äôt anything much till Tsusiat. You can camp &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; anywhere, but there is a 5km or so stretch between the two with no camping due to animal activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed out with some damp gear, but nothing too bad from last night heading. Cribbs was really close to Bonilla and I went through there at 9:30am, so I wasn‚Äôt going to stop there. This was pretty much all on the beach and easy hiking as the sun started to work it‚Äôs way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362981605&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail alternated with little bits inland and the beach before inland towards Nitinaht. I was feeling pretty good here still and powering along quite happily. Views were getting better and the trails were improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020782.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;I wish every hike was this beautiful.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Nitinaht ferry there‚Äôs the Crabshack which serves crabs and other delicacies like bags of chips and pop. I went for a grill cheese which took 40 minutes, but was worth it. A quick ferry ride across the river led me on to the trail so I could keep powering towards Tsusiat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the trail is high up on a cliff, close to the edge with fantastic views. And here I met my first bear. It saw me first and darted at 90% to me across the trail. I quickly saw 2 cubs shoot up a tree. I backed of and fumbled for my bear spray shouting ‚ÄúBear‚Äù at the top of my voice to warn others and something to make noise to keep the bear aware of where I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 4 minutes of not seeing any bear and shouting until I felt like an idiot, I inched forward, bear spray at the ready. It was long gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020816.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;One of the many random beaches without people on that you see from the trail. Just amazing.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of hike to Tsusiat was uneventful, but getting even more pretty including a cool sea arch that I only just made the tides for. That night I was surrounded by tons of people but the waterfall and sea meant I didn‚Äôt hear much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020837.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Tents and waterfall at Tsusiat.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-four-tsusiat-falls-to-michigan-creek&quot;&gt;Day four: Tsusiat Falls to Michigan Creek&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;12.64km in 5h 14min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the number of campsites is limited, Michigan Creek is the last formal campsite. Darling River campsite is closed due to bear activity, so Michigan seemed like the best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362981453&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a combination of beach and trail up on the cliffs. Probably one of the most scenic sections with views down to the rocks and bluffs and beaches. Some serious ladders and a bit of mud, but overall the trail is really good at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsocowis Creek is a lovely spot with a nice campsite that had no one there. I stopped, put up the hammock and had a good nap. The hike to Michigan Creek is along the beach with a couple of streams to ford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiking was pretty easy and I still felt good, able to power along and got to Michigan Creek in the early afternoon. I spent a while failing to set up my hammock, none of the trees were quite right. Finally settled on a spot in the trees with my tent and chilled‚Ä¶ only to find I‚Äôd lost my camera &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Aargh. I knew the last time I used it was Tsocowis Creek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020869.JPG&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Bridge over waterfall at Tsocowis Creek.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After ages searching the campground, asking people and retracing my steps I was at a loss. So I grabbed my Spot, my bear spray and hiked the 9km return to Tsocowis Creek to see if it was there. It wasn‚Äôt. So really I did 21km+ this day, but 9km of it was in the sun without a backpack - nice and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that night someone found the camera next to their tent. Yay üòÉ&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3472.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Evening at Michigan Creek&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-five-michigan-creek-to-pachena-access&quot;&gt;Day five: Michigan Creek to Pachena Access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;12.62km in 3h 24min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably tell the times are getting shorter and shorter for similar distances. The differences in the trail, the quality of the infrastructure and the quality of the trail is like night and day. If the first day is a hike on the hardest North shore trail, this is a walk on Stanley Park. It‚Äôs mostly in great condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362971051&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another bear sighting, which ran off quickly once it spotted me. Sea lion rock is awesome and is a few rocks full of sea lions. Was as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020881.JPG&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Sea lion rock is loud and fun to watch.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few hours I turned up at the beautiful beach at Pachena and I was done at 12:30pm, one day early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020891.JPG&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;The end at Pachena beach.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail bus crew were able to move my reservation up a day and by 5:30pm I was in Nanaimo waiting for a ferry home and kinda wishing I was able to turn back and do the whole trail once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trail is beautiful&lt;/em&gt; in that special west coast way, similar to Haida Gwaii and so on. Long empty beaches, bears, eagles, ravens, sea otters and just continuous beauty. I hope I never get tired this amazing coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trail is muddy&lt;/em&gt; beyond anyway I thought possible. It‚Äôs really bad and that makes it really slippy. It‚Äôs what makes the trail harder and I can‚Äôt imagine how bad it is in the rain. You need gaiters and poles for the mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Difficulty is subjective&lt;/em&gt;. I didn‚Äôt find it that hard, because I‚Äôve spent years hiking on the North Shore and it is similar to the harder trails. If you don‚Äôt do this kind of hiking regularly, if you‚Äôve got a big backpack you will find it &lt;strong&gt;very tough&lt;/strong&gt;. I think back to the experience some people had said they had hiking (almost none) and their backpack weight (very heavy) on the bus to the trail and cringe, I hope they made it in the time they had allotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Light is better&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to backpacking. The majority of accidents are people slipping and if you are fatigued from carrying a 60lb backpack and trying to negotiate this trail, you are more likely to have a serious slip. I didn‚Äôt feel I missed anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It‚Äôs more sanitised than I expected&lt;/em&gt;. I did go 4 hours at a time without seeing people and I did camp by myself. But those were the exceptions, it‚Äôs become quite popular and all the rivers have bridges or cable cars. There is support and exit points if you have an accident and that‚Äôs all good. But I‚Äôm craving something more remote, maybe the North Coast trail, Haida Gwaii etc. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this hike and my time on the trail so much and I missed it as soon as I was done. I would do it again. Those last three days in the sun were amazing and I ‚ù§Ô∏è this part of the world, so very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3486.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Felt good to be done and now I can get to a hot shower and my daughters graduation. And maybe a beer.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üëã I‚Äôll be back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I used an old camera for pictures. This meant I could leave my phone off and only use it for emergencies and not have to carry a battery pack. This was much lighter and worked well.¬†&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;

<title>Fourth Trip - Stein Valley</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-25-stein-valley/"/>
<updated>2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/stein-valley</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite places in BC is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/stein_val/&quot;&gt;Stein Valley Nlaka‚Äôpamux Heritage Park&lt;/a&gt;, located by Lytton, BC. It‚Äôs special for a couple of reasons. It‚Äôs one of the only large unlogged watersheds &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_River&quot;&gt;left in BC&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs much warmer than everywhere else, making it ideal for trips when you want to avoid rain, or weather elsewhere is crappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park is big, with one main trail that comes in from the west side of the Fraser River and goes up to the Stein Lake, 50km+ away. This means there is really only one main trail and route in the park with not many options until you get up to the lake. Once you get up the lake passes and trails exist through over to the west to Blowdown Creek etc. This is serious alpine wilderness hiking, which unfortunately I haven‚Äôt been able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan was to head up for three days and enjoy the weather. It was also a trial for the West Coast Trail trip as I haven‚Äôt back packed in a while‚Ä¶ instead using a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-one-heading-up-the-stein&quot;&gt;Day one: heading up the Stein&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry to the Stein means going through Lytton and seeing first hand the devastation of the heat dome last year. The scarred and twisted remains of the centre of the town are just heartbreaking. It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say that the town is just gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the Stein you can take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/passenger-travel/water-travel/inland-ferries/lytton-reaction-ferry&quot;&gt;reaction ferry&lt;/a&gt; across the river. Except because of flooding and high snow melt, the ferry was closed. The ramp to get onto the ferry was flooded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7293015309&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two choices left; the rail bridge to the south of Lytton and then an 8km hike up to the park trailhead or the suspension bridge and a ~2km hike. We went for the latter. It looks like this and with a 30km+ wind howling up the Fraser it made an interesting crossing while carrying a large backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3377.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the hike was pretty straightforward, beautiful forests by a raging river. Pictographs carved on rock and lots of camping sites in 28c sunny weather, sounds pretty good to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We camped at Devils Staircase campground, which isn‚Äôt a staircase and isn‚Äôt really hard or devilish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-two-leaving-the-stein&quot;&gt;Day two: leaving the Stein&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan for day two was to head further into the Stein, without our backpacks. We set off heading north and hit a snag. About 1km north of the campground the trail is badly washed out with a gully of death leading right down to the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was seriously steep, seriously sketchy and with a very large penalty if you slipped. I just wasn‚Äôt comfortable crossing, I tried and nearly lost it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at that point, we headed back, packed up and reluctantly headed out of the Stein Valley and found a gin and tonic instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out in almost 30c heat, hiking up hills with 40lb+ backpacks and crossing the suspension bridge of doom was enough to wipe us out. Getting back to the car, we definitely felt like we‚Äôd done a good hike and we enjoyed our gin and tonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have the ambition to get to the Stein Lake and do the Stein Valley traverse, ideally by crossing over from Blowdown Creek or Lizzie Pass. But not this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Packing Light</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-25-packing-light/"/>
<updated>2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/packing-light</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my upcoming West Coast trail I was determined to pack light. The difference between a 11.3kg (25lb) and 22.6kg (50lb) backpack on your ability to hike is huge. I really felt that difference on the Stein Valley where I had a 19.9kg backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The West Coast trail is 75km, takes the average person 6-8 days and involves lots of rough terrain. The main causes of emergency evacuation from the West Coast Trail or evacuation and injuries due to slips and falls. The majority of the latter come from people with overloaded packs and tired people. A lighter pack reduces fatigue and reduces the chance of injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Stein Valley my 65L pack weighed 19.9kg (44lbs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the West Coast Trail my 40L pack weighed 11.8kg (26lbs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs what was in it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3459.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs what it looked like packed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3460.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That‚Äôs food and gear for 6 nights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; as I hiked I moved more stuff inside and moved the tent onto the bottom of the pack to reduce snags and catching things on the side. It also made my backpack cover fit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;big-wins&quot;&gt;Big Wins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/tags/gear/&quot;&gt;gear page for details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 40L backpack&lt;/strong&gt; is lighter than my 65L one. That‚Äôs partly because its smaller, but also because its a lot newer. The 65L one is over 20 years old still good but things have advanced a long way since then. The 40L backpack is 2.1kg lighter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My tent&lt;/strong&gt; is a bit of a pain to put up and sleep in, suffering from wind, condensation and camping on sand (all of which happen on the West Coast Trail). However &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-04-04-a-tent/&quot;&gt;it weighs 517g&lt;/a&gt;, including pegs. You don‚Äôt need to carry poles because you just hiking poles. Win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My sleeping bag&lt;/strong&gt; is 530g and &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-04-05-sleeping-bag/&quot;&gt;packs down super small&lt;/a&gt;. Add in a base layer or thermal set for sleeping which weighed 315g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clothes&lt;/strong&gt; I ended up with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;shorts and t-shirt for hot weather&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pants and top for the normal west coast weather&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;pants and top for cold or very wet weather&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gloves and toque&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3 pairs of socks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a thin but warm top (329g)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a waterproof jacket (410g)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means I was re-wearing clothes, but able to layer together up to 4 or 5 layers together if I really needed it. No need to carry a puffy down jacket, just use smart layers to build for the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food&lt;/strong&gt; is all dehydrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oats for breakfast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cliff bars and dried mango for snacks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;dehydrated food for dinner in bags&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;herbal tea bags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooking&lt;/strong&gt; is done using a &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-06-25-a-stove/&quot;&gt;Jetboil Flash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My one luxury was a hammock (at 200g) for when I just wanted to relax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a bunch of other miscellaneous bits of pieces, dry bags, satellite tracker, toilet roll and so on. But those things above are the biggest sources of space and weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key here for me was to be ruthless, I know all the weights of these because I measured everything and put it on a spreadsheet. The difference between the yellow gore-tex Sugoi jacket and a blue MEC gore-tex jacket was 200g, something I hadn‚Äôt really thought about until I weighed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep weighing things and be ruthless about what you do and don‚Äôt need. You have to be ready for any weather and any situation, you have to ensure you don‚Äôt get cold and face hypothermia - but you don‚Äôt have to take everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hiked the West Coast Trail with people carrying 65lb backpacks and goggled at the stuff they brought. I think they probably felt the same too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples that made me wonder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A tent that required 18 pegs to be set up. 18!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person carrying cucumber as food. Cucumber is 96% water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person carrying cans of tuna. Those cans contain water or oil and then you have to pack out the cans.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A person who brought in 3 saws to the West Coast Trail so they could cut up firewood.
‚Ä¶and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But respect to the people who don‚Äôt bother with tents at all, they are hardcore.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A stove</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-25-a-stove/"/>
<updated>2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/a-stove</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the past for camping I‚Äôve used a primus stove like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.primusequipment.com/4a5848/globalassets/catalogs/primus/p3/p351/p35111/p351110/nocolor/351110_essential_trail_stove.jpg?width=680&amp;amp;height=680&amp;amp;mode=BoxPad&amp;amp;bgcolor=fff&amp;amp;quality=80&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It need a pot, a pot handle and a fuel canister. It was better for cooking than some of the other stoves we had, but it has some problems. The flames aren‚Äôt very focused, tending to go up the side and it needs a lot of fuel. Fuel is heavy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my West Coast Trail trip I was determined to be lightweight, that means the only food I took was dehydrated. Fresh water is in abundance on the West Coast Trail and I realised all I was ever doing was boiling water, I don‚Äôt need pots or pans. I won‚Äôt be cooking for frying anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jetboil.com/&quot;&gt;Jetboil&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://johnsonoutdoors.widen.net/content/ejkh4iomht/png/1114606_primary.png?w=1040&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If all you do is boil water, this is what you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the Jetboil on the West Coast Trail and loved it for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It boils really fast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The colour coding on the side tells you when its boiled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When its boiled, you don‚Äôt need to fiddle with pans or pan handles, the cover allows you to pick it up and pour. It‚Äôs just really easy to use.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs really light.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs efficient which means you can carry less fuel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for the fuel alone, using the Jetboil meant I could carry one 200g tank of fuel for 5 days of hiking. I would normally carry one &lt;strong&gt;large&lt;/strong&gt; fuel tank, at least 500g+ (haven‚Äôt got a full one to weigh). Because the old stove is that inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to carry less and lighter, saving myself carrying multiple items and at least 500g. Over half the people on the trail, if not more, had a Jetboil or similar system.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Watch</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-08-a-watch/"/>
<updated>2022-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/a-watch</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On my racing bike I have a Wahoo Element Bolt and sensors for speed, cadence and power. On my gravel bike I have none of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I started doing longer bike trips I realised I didn‚Äôt really want all that information. I don‚Äôt care about speed, just the time and how long it is to my destination. I want to enjoy the ride. I don‚Äôt want to maintain an average speed, or care about my power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These trips are for enjoying the ride. So I started using my watch that I use for running and hiking instead to record the trips. The advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The battery lasts for ever&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have to manually look at my wrist to see information&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have only the information I care about and nothing else&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A few less gadgets to worry about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://coros.com/pace2&quot;&gt;Coros Pace 2&lt;/a&gt; for a while now and love it. It offers ‚Äú20 Days For Regular Use/30 Hours In Full GPS Mode‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure about that, but I haven‚Äôt had to charge it on any trip so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controls are two buttons which are easy to operate in the cold, rain or when you are tired. It does what I want, records activity and tells me the information I need. Would highly recommend if you want something simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison my Apple Watch died before I completed a marathon (admittedly a long one up a mountain). The Apple Watch was so complicated it did random stuff and was hard to read and operate. In the cold, rain or when sweaty it would be so hard to use.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>From the Troller to the Raven</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-07-the-raven/"/>
<updated>2022-06-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/the-raven</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 1986 Spirit of the West released the album &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripping_Up_the_Stairs&quot;&gt;Tripping up the Stairs&lt;/a&gt;. On that album was a song ‚ÄúThe Crawl‚Äù on &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.apple.com/ca/album/the-crawl/1273513877?i=1273513884&quot;&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc4eYv2Oyq8&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The album details a pub crawl along the North Shore ‚ÄúFrom the Troller to the Raven with all stops inbetween‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spirit of the West are no more and at the end of the June the Raven won‚Äôt be&lt;/strong&gt;. Multiple people have told me and confirmed by staff that the end of June 2022, the Raven, established 1979 will be closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent.fcxh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/281104355_5315095888535669_5475206090518731323_n.jpg?stp=c0.9.526.274a_dst-jpg_p526x296&amp;amp;_nc_cat=109&amp;amp;ccb=1-7&amp;amp;_nc_sid=340051&amp;amp;_nc_ohc=o03CX2dRhMoAX9VDBF0&amp;amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fcxh3-1.fna&amp;amp;oh=00_AT9pm3MQekHwUyYidJ2WPwRYq3w-vccG1lLGpcxpKn12wA&amp;amp;oe=62A458F6&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The song &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;amp;q=spirit+of+the+west+the+crawl&quot;&gt;tells the story&lt;/a&gt; of doing a pub crawl from the Troller in Horseshoe Bay all the over to Deep Cove. It mentions a few pubs on the way Park Royal Hotel (closed), The Rusty Gull (open), Square Rigger (open), Queen‚Äôs Cross (open). Unfortunately when they get to the Raven, they get the last beer to find they‚Äôd lost half their friends and had no money to get a taxi and were walking home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Raven for the first time with my then to be wife on my first visit to Canada - over 29 years ago. Since we now live two blocks away, we tend to go there a lot more than we used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of the demise of the Raven is simple greed. The story (as I know it) is that the buildings were taken over by a developer who wanted to turn into condos. The district denied their rezoning plans. The developer has since tripled rents and made the businesses their untenable and one-by-one they‚Äôve all been leaving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs hung on as long as it has. Over the last many years it‚Äôs been on its last legs. The beer has gone downhill with less craft beer and become very expensive. The mens toilets have been in various states of disrepair. The food has varied greatly, depending on the chefs - ‚Äòve gone through plenty. We‚Äôve had food with no cutlery, pizza with metal bits in it, orders messed up. Sometimes poutine that was cold, had plastic in it, was more gravy than anything and so on. With COVID-19 they got a patio to supplement the tiny sunless one by the road - it‚Äôs in the parking lot with a fantastic view of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet I still like going to the Raven. It was for me and many an extension of our living rooms. A few weeks ago I was there and saw 5 different groups of friends as people came and went over the evening. No need to get tables or order food - people would just pop in and out. We‚Äôd turn up after skiing on Mt Seymour, or biking on the mountain, or kayaking on the ocean in whatever we were wearing and have a drink with friends and no-one would care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it did end up being pretty crap, I will miss the Raven and I think Deep Cove will be worse because of it‚Äôs loss.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Third Trip - South Vancouver Island</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-07-south-vancouver-island/"/>
<updated>2022-06-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/south-vancouver-island</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks after my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-second-trip/&quot;&gt;second trip&lt;/a&gt;, it was time to head out on my second trip. I‚Äôve been finding long trips to other countries expensive and hard to organize and I absolutely love British Columbia, so I decided just to spend more time here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend mentioned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cowichancrusher.com/&quot;&gt;Cowichan Crusher&lt;/a&gt; fondo and my course was set. I had a few days spare before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.valleygranfondo.com/&quot;&gt;Valley Fondo&lt;/a&gt;, so didn‚Äôt want to go too crazy so instead went to southern Vancouver Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this trip I planned on camping, so went with full gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-deep-cover-to-lake-cowichan&quot;&gt;Day 1: Deep Cover to Lake Cowichan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs warm up for the Fondo by doing a 120km ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7218875101&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out this route is pretty straightforward, avoiding the highway is still a struggle and there‚Äôs still choke points where you have to go on the highway north of Cedar, around Ladysmith and near the turn off to Lake Cowichan. At this point I did not know about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvrd.ca/121/Cowichan-Valley-Trail&quot;&gt;Cowichan Valley Trail&lt;/a&gt; which goes from Duncan to Lake Cowichan (and more), if you go this way look it up to avoid roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-cowichan-crusher&quot;&gt;Day 2: Cowichan Crusher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out it‚Äôs not 100+km, but actually 91km. The route was published on the Friday night and listed over 1760m of elevation, but it was only 1084m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7224179380&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an out and back along the south side of Lake Cowichan. Started off with a bit of road, then wide logging roads and undulating hills. At 40km there was a loop and an insane hill that was really steep. I now have 38-42 gearing and was struggling up it. When I saw people walking at the same speed I was grinding, I eventually swallowed my pride and walked up the last bit. The slope down was even steeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a small event that was fun. I didn‚Äôt focus on trying to do amazing, just have some fun and get some gravel in. Of course, it was a race and there were other people so soon my racing instinct took over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to ditch all my gear at the start so didn‚Äôt have to lug it around. After a pub lunch with a friend, I went to my campsite and promptly got lost on the way there. So ended up over 118km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7229659808&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got to the campsite, it was lovely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3243.JPG&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I had a bit of a problem. My original plan was to head to Port Renfrew, then Sooke, then back to Lake Cowichan and home by Wednesday with two rest days before the Valley Fondo. There were two problems: the forecast was a lot of rain and I had many sores from two long days (not going to go into details there, suffice to say I was in pain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3-lets-try-going-to-nanaimo&quot;&gt;Day 3: Let‚Äôs try going to Nanaimo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on how I felt I reluctantly decided to head home. I felt this was the second time I‚Äôd failed at a full Vancouver Island trip, but I wanted my body to recover before the Fondo. But I thought I‚Äôd add a twist. Instead of repeating day 1 and doing the highway, I‚Äôd try a new route - this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/lake-cowichan-to-nanaimo.png&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This route was spectacular. Soaring mountains, rivers, a road that turned into a logging road and got narrowers. Waterfalls, bear poop, deer and no people. And it went up and up and got smaller and narrower. And steeper. Then it became unrideable. For a long time. Then I was fording streams, then trees were across the road. Then snow, deep snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was before it went really wrong:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3270.JPG&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hadn‚Äôt ridden my bike for about an hour when I had to make a decision. I was aiming for Nanaimo but had 62km to go and was in snow and getting pretty lost. I had all the gear to camp out, but realised I was unprepared and lacking information on where I was going. It‚Äôs well and good camping, but if you are going the wrong way, it could go very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to turn back to Lake Cowichan. Oh but on the way, my tubeless tyre sprung a leak. It was right on the rim, so I think the rim seal (if that‚Äôs a thing failed). My repair kit didn‚Äôt work so I pulled the tyre off and stuffed in a tube. I only had one spare tube, so was in for a long walk if anything else failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After and 7 hours and 102km 1,259m elevation I got back to a cheap hotel - I needed a hot shower and couldn‚Äôt face another 20km+ to the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7229660119&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the warm pub, absolutely wiped and very, very sore I realised I‚Äôd missed a turning. That turning would have lead me along a contour line, to the top of a valley and down most of the rest of the way. If I‚Äôd carried on going I would have just ended up at top of a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned, research and get good maps for when you go off on logging roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4-lake-cowichan-to-deep-cove-the-boring-way&quot;&gt;Day 4: Lake Cowichan to Deep Cove, the boring way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y‚Äôknow, following roads and trails that are well established. I did give up at Park Royal and my wife met me, I was wiped. It was still a 115km day so I averaged 100km+ each day and some decent elevation. This is a higher average distance each day than my previous 2 trips and I felt it in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7235049728&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlight was that I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvrd.ca/121/Cowichan-Valley-Trail&quot;&gt;Cowichan Valley Trail&lt;/a&gt; which goes from Lake Cowichan straight into Duncan on a old train line. It‚Äôs fast easy and delightful 25km+ of trail that I‚Äôd recommend to anyone going that way. I was able to stop in Duncan and pick up some tubes from a local bike shop and then work my way up the coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusions&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should carry more than one spare tube.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Definitely research logging roads more and have a better map than just Google maps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I enjoyed camping so much the second night, I wish I‚Äôd camped the third night too. I‚Äôm bored of hotels and the camping was delightful - at the time my brain was just focused on the first place to crash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My five day trip got shortened by a single day by adding an absolutely epic exploration day by accident, so the trip was pretty good. I don‚Äôt feel bad I didn‚Äôt get to Nanaimo that way, it was a super exciting and interesting ride. I probably wouldnt do it again that way though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to note that after day 2 I did adjust my seat slightly and that seemed to help, but it did take a couple of days of not riding for things to heal.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Second Trip - Maui</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-second-trip/"/>
<updated>2022-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/second-trip</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks after my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-first-trip/&quot;&gt;first trip&lt;/a&gt; it was time to head out on my second trip. The weather in Vancouver and British Columbia has been unseasonably cold and very frustrating. I wanted to go somewhere warm. There are lots of choices, but all of sudden they all got really expensive. On a whim I found a cheap flight to Maui and off I went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;changes-from-my-first-trip&quot;&gt;Changes from my first trip&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip had a few differences: I was flying, Maui is really warm, I was never staying anywhere too remote. For this reason I decided not to pack stove, cooking gear, or food. I could live without a good cup of tea for a week. This meant I could remove my frame bag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife also pointed out that we had an air mattress that compacted smaller and it fit nicely into my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-panniers/&quot;&gt;new panniers&lt;/a&gt;, meaning I could take one dry bag less as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out camping is really hard to find in Maui. Covid has meant that availability is limited and some have just closed. Here‚Äôs the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù campsites that are left (excluding walk in ones at the top of Haleakala):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/camping-maui.png&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@20.6704429,-156.5285182,10.41z/data=!4m2!10m1!1e1&quot;&gt;Google map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search for campsites on Maui you might find more including state parks that are ‚Äúgood for camping‚Äù. You‚Äôll probably also find lots of websites saying you can camp on any beach as long as you have a fishing rod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these places are better than other. The road either side of Lahaina certainly had lots of cars and tents parked up camping on beaches and space for others. So you probably could camp there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I‚Äôm worried enough generally about safety in the US from private property to people with guns that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that based on what some random websites say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I could only get a total of 3 nights camping out of my 7 there. I would have liked more, but it resulted in me getting in the rides I wanted so it‚Äôs not so bad. If like me, you want to camp in campsites with facilities and less worries - book early. The resulting trip and locations I stayed in is a result of booking late and trying to avoid the expensive areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-jet-lag-and-assemble-bike&quot;&gt;Day 1: Jet lag and assemble bike&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed in Kahului, assembled my bike after a 10:30pm arrival the night before. Most hotels will not store bike boxes or anything overnight, but I did persuade one nice person at the hotel to do it for me (cost a bit in tips).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7110978753/embed/5cd626998d8e95ebbfab65f71002802ad2c22b23&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was just a quick shake out ride and then a visit to Walmart to stock up on groceries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-kahului-to-olowalu&quot;&gt;Day 2: Kahului to Olowalu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first long ride, ending up with campsite and a beach in Olowalu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7121391240/embed/73b811f333e399e90f3795b6eccd0260a273df53&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2052.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely loved this ride. It was gorgeous, very sunny and unbelieveably windy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a big hill coming out of Kahului - its always good to start with the hill and get it out of the way. The village of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kahakuloa,+HI+96793,+USA/@21.0009245,-156.5628451,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!1m2!10m1!1e1!3m4!1s0x7eab2bdab3f68513:0x65c8e7836e04e78!8m2!3d21.0009085!4d-156.55406&quot;&gt;Kahakuloa&lt;/a&gt; marks the transition from the hill - it‚Äôs a good place for drinks and banana bread and has spectacular scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next section is all cliff side roads, with fantastic views. At the beginning the road gets very, very narrow but does soon even out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last big transition is around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/D.T.+Fleming+Park/@21.0058175,-156.6468452,14.43z/data=!4m8!1m2!10m1!1e1!3m4!1s0x7eaad5c776457c77:0x9160a3ac662334d7!8m2!3d21.0048584!4d-156.6513703&quot;&gt;DT Fleming Park&lt;/a&gt; where it turns into a highway with a wide shoulder. This is a good place to stop for toilet and water top up before cruising down the highway for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3-olowalu-to-kihei&quot;&gt;Day 3: Olowalu to Kihei&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning I had to make a decision, to try &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Olowalu+Beach,+Hawaii+96761,+United+States/Haleakala+Crater,+Hawaii,+USA/@20.7946001,-156.5663247,11z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x7954d620a4d0104d:0x6a34602b0ffa082e!2m2!1d-156.6156274!2d20.8090713!1m5!1m1!1s0x7954c811eeb96541:0x864843523f88c0bc!2m2!1d-156.2535131!2d20.7096826!3e1&quot;&gt;Haleakala Crater&lt;/a&gt; or not. I felt that if I did that, I would absolutely wipe myself out for a couple of days. I was also feeling tired from my previous days ride. Jet lag, or first big exercise since my marathon? Not sure, but I decided to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I took a leisurely ride from Olowalu over to Kihei and had a nice lunch and layabout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7122582736/embed/a5602855ad48294a11ca7d3487719d7ac0222f26&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a flat ride, a good chunk on a busy highway. It also had brutal headwinds that seemed to change and hit me each way. At one point I just gave up riding and walked my bike along the sandy beach instead, tough life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2081.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4-olowalu-to-kahului&quot;&gt;Day 4: Olowalu to Kahului&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big ride was coming up, around Hana and I‚Äôd got a hotel back in Kahului to act as the launch point. So I wanted this day to be relatively quiet as well, but I did some of the simple short 20km route yesterday and it wasn‚Äôt that fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead I went the long way back to Kahului and reversed my route from the day before. Why the heck not, it was gorgeous. This time I got to stop at some different places on the way and it was just as amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7127821053/embed/4ed5c263f566ddae06399b7d295827833db5688f&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one hill that almost defeated me, called ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7127821053/segments/2959625694434573968&quot;&gt;Strava shows as 15.8%&lt;/a&gt; but feels more like 18%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2120.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-5-kahului-to-kipahulu&quot;&gt;Day 5: Kahului to Kipahulu&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the big one that I‚Äôd been looking forward to. I‚Äôd been lucky enough to get a campsite a Kipahulu, which is down in Haleakala National Park and half way around east Maui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ‚ù§Ô∏è the east side of Maui and was looking forward to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people recommend doing this counter clockwise to avoid tourist traffic heading out to Hana. I did this clockwise because the week before the road near &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kaupo,+HI+96790,+USA/@20.6364922,-156.1309922,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!1m2!10m1!1e1!3m4!1s0x7954ba30cdccfdb5:0xcfee263a13947dc3!8m2!3d20.6364792!4d-156.1222243&quot;&gt;Kaupo&lt;/a&gt; has been washed out and it was impassable. I wanted to ensure that I didn‚Äôt cycle counter clockwise, get to Kaupo and then be stuck and have to do a 170km diversion to get to my campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7138008219/embed/5df4b9d3bbf2ef1ee38149d9ec0d8159eb4b726d&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the road until it gets into the ‚Äúroad to Hana‚Äù is mostly forgettable and a bit hilly. But then it turns into the most magnificient road ever. It generally flows really nicely and provides comfortable riding with amazing views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tourists are annoying as air conditioned tourists fight to pass each other in their rented SUVs that are far too big for the road and then park at each stop. But they didn‚Äôt really get in the way of riding and because they weren‚Äôt going fast generally were safe to be around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a wonderful drink and snack stop at Halfway to Hana that kindly filled up all my water bottles. After that you‚Äôve got a long climb, so its good to fill up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tourists run around at Hana, but that‚Äôs such a shame. The road down to Kipahulu just gets better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The campsite is spectacular and it was basically empty. I had a nice chat with the camp manager and in the past the camp was repeatedly overrun with people that were abusing the site. So they‚Äôve introduced reservations and limited the number of visitors. If you can get a spot it‚Äôs worth it, amazing campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2177.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn‚Äôt be a visit to the national park without a hike up to the waterfalls that evening would it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7138007945/embed/8aba46fa2f77129d77cae7ca9f1aad5323ea7d90&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a tiring day, on top of a good ride yesterday and I slept well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-6-kipahulu-to-kahului&quot;&gt;Day 6: Kipahulu to Kahului&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road was open. Funnily enough there were a few rental cars that really shouldn‚Äôt have been there either, but that‚Äôs always the way. This was another amazing ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The road is advertised as four wheel drive only. It‚Äôs just fine for a bike. A road bike would probably be ok, just take it easy on the gravelly bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts with being close to the sea and beaches. Then it starts to open out and you get to climb. And climb. And climb. Many short steep sections. There is no water for 45km and 1,000 meters and it was getting up to 28c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7138008275/embed/f53b039a252167d21f91c1166f0f405e3de2d203&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This where I started to struggle. But I just rested a few times and enjoyed the remoteness. On one side you had the sea, the other the volcano stretching up with the observatory on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_2238.JPG&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 45km you get to the Maui Winery and general store that sold water and food. It was a most welcome sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the climbing doesn‚Äôt stop until you reach the road that branches off to Haleakala. I didn‚Äôt take that and instead cruised dow the hill into Kahului - a nice chance to get my average speed up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-7-recovery-and-fly-home&quot;&gt;Day 7: Recovery and fly home&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a break, my legs hurt, I was a bit sunburnt (no rain at all) and tired. So I packed my bike and lay on the beach drinking a beer and reading a book for a few hours before heading home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maui isn‚Äôt a big island and accomodation is a problem. If I did it again, I‚Äôd probably aim for a week in an apartment somewhere like Kihei and just use that as a base. Do west Maui in one day, then spend a day on the beach. Then do the volcano, then a day on the beach. That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winds are really, really strong. I‚Äôm glad I left my frame bag at home, it would have provided more surface area for the wind to catch. It was hard enough as it was. Minimize your surface area for the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally the Kihei and Lahaina areas are for tourists. Sandy beaches, no rain, no wind. That‚Äôs not the part of Maui that I love. The north shore of west Maui and the east side of Maui are beautiful, wild, remote and just perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Panniers</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-panniers/"/>
<updated>2022-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/panniers</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-first-trip/&quot;&gt;first trip&lt;/a&gt; I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5047-621/Division-Double-Pannier&quot;&gt;these panniers&lt;/a&gt; from MEC that were on my wife‚Äôs bike already. There was a few downsides I discovered with these panniers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They aren‚Äôt that big.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They aren‚Äôt waterproof.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The velcro to hold it down doesn‚Äôt always stick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are fine for the trips my wife does, to and from school which takes 10 minutes. They hold up to the worst Vancouver rain for 10 minutes. However 8 hours of rain is another story, they got wet inside. Plus the velcro didn‚Äôt stay shut and then I worried about things falling out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ended up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://waterflyshop.com/products/waterfly-bike-pannier-bag&quot;&gt;these panniers&lt;/a&gt;. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bigger, holding 25L according to the spec.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waterproof, although I haven‚Äôt had them in 8 hours of rain yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Will stay closed thanks to lots of clips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that they are not light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first trip I was able to get all my usual gear in and have space for more. The sidepockets were really helpful for storing phones and tools in. So far, quite happy.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Loading it up</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-loading-it-up/"/>
<updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/loading-it-up</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my first trip I needed to loaded up my bike with gear. This is going to be a continual learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs my bike full loaded &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-04-24-first-trip/&quot;&gt;on my first trip&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1913.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I didn‚Äôt go the usual bike packing way of a large handlebar bag and a behind the seat bag for a few reasons. I found most of the handlebar bags quite restrictive - they take up a lot of space where my hands would normally go. I found that extremely wierd. I‚Äôve ridden with a rack and saddle bags for ages, I find it comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I‚Äôm probably going to be doing more bike touring than bike packing and I‚Äôm rarely going to be doing anything too technical and mountain bike like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I‚Äôve got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mec.ca/en/product/6000-588/Nano-X-Hail-Dry-Bag?colour=Zinnia&quot;&gt;MEC 5L dry bags&lt;/a&gt; on the front&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-full-frame-pack/&quot;&gt;middle frame bag from Apidura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-full-frame-pack/&quot;&gt;panniers from MEC&lt;/a&gt; that I stole from my wife‚Äôs bag. In there was another MEC dry bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One dry bag that we had lying around on the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dividing everything up logically I was then able to pack this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleeping back and thermals in one of the front dry bags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of my remaining clothes in the other front dry bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleeping mat in the dry bag lying on the top of the rack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One dry bag containing all other things that should stay dry in one pannier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tent in the other pannier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food and all heavy stuff in the middle frame bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remaining stuff (fuel, stove, pots, first aid kit, rope etc) distributed around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seemed to work well, although I made a few changes as I went along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ended up with a few heavy things in the sleeping mat bag. This meant they slid to the back of the bike and caused it to be unstable when standing or cornering. I moved them into the frame bag to be directly over the bottom bracket and that helped a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I found a few things I needed quickly on a cold wet ride: hats, buffs, waterproofs. I quickly redistributed these to places I could get them quickly. The dry bags on the front forks were ideal for just one or two things at the top like this. Quick and easy to get in and out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The panniers had two big flaws, I‚Äôm looking for replacements. They aren‚Äôt fully waterproof (as the website says). They are fine for short journeys, but 8+hrs of cycling in the rain‚Ä¶ no. The velcro can open up when they are overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The frame bag got quickly disorganised because its so big. I need to find a way to organise it better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall once I got the weight distribution better, it worked out well. Until I took a bikepacking.com route and ended up on trails that are just not designed for me with panniers. But it was still fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1935.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The bike was not gonna fit down some of these parts of the trail.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>First trip - Vancouver island</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-first-trip/"/>
<updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/first-trip</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All right, so this first trip is a bit of an odd one in that I wanted to do an overnight or more trip to test everything out. Make sure I liked cycling long distances followed by camping. I wanted to do it locally, but the weather really wasn‚Äôt co-operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to get back home for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmovanmarathon.ca/&quot;&gt;my marathon&lt;/a&gt; so I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com&quot;&gt;bikepacking.com&lt;/a&gt; and picked a route that seemed hard (but maybe doable) but also had a good plan B option if it didn‚Äôt work out. So I looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com/routes/tree-to-sea-loop-vancouver-island/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and said ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the start of this ride is a multi-day ride. This was an ambitious choice that wasn‚Äôt going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-deep-cove-to-sechelt&quot;&gt;Day 1: Deep cove to Sechelt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good ride to the Horseshoe bay ferry. Was nice to see friends on the way. Waiting at the ferry for two hours really cooled me down though üò¢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the ferry, there‚Äôs those nice hills in Gibsons to contend with, ugh. The rest of the ride to Sechelt is nice and Porpoise Bay is a beautiful campground with a special bike section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1913.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night was cold, there was a wind warning and the wind was blowing across the campground. Because I wasn‚Äôt sure, I just grabbed most things and stuck them in the tent with me, leaving the bike to face the cold on it‚Äôs own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also put my food in a dry bag up a tree, because they‚Äôve removed all bear proofing equipment from the cycling campground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-sechelt-to-comox&quot;&gt;Day 2: Sechelt to Comox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7004944540/embed/3458e9256de0f65fa111ca292a8dde7612e8e9c5&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; missing from Strava is the first 10km that I forgot to record from the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It rained overnight, but it wasn‚Äôt raining when I first woke up. It was just still windy. That meant I could pack up and get on my way easily enough for the misery that was about to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I passed Sechelt, it got really windy. Multiple times I was being blown sideways as the wind howled off the sea. Then it started to rain. Then I realised how much I hate this part of the highway. From Sechelt to Earls Cove it‚Äôs continual short steep climbs and descents. I was continually going from low gear to high gear and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Earls Cove I was cold, wet, battered and tired. I pulled into Earls Cove and had perfect timing straight onto the ferry. Ran upstairs and got a cup of tea to warm up. I was wiped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some nice man offered to drive me to Powell River, but I refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the ferry to Powell River is better, there‚Äôs a big uphill, some flats and long downhills. It has nice wide shoulders and is easy to maintain a momentum. There was a two hour wait in a warm waiting room at Powell River for the next ferry as the wind and rain lashed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this point I made a decision to spend a night in Comox at a hotel and not turn right towards Campbell River and try camping. I realised I was not physically or mentally prepared for the original route, up to Cape Scott, and I went for plan B. I chose this route because I knew I could back out easily if I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3-comox-to-parksville&quot;&gt;Day 3: Comox to Parksville&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7009588975/embed/a5d7e73a0f16fdb94184a4c64000b80528449490&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of north, I aimed south and made plans with a friend to stay on Salt Spring island on the way back. Cape Scott and northern Vancouver island will still be there for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a wonderful day, great riding in the sun on the quiet coastal road. The road is spectacular and has little traffic. Qualicum Beach and Parksville were lovely. I was aiming for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com/routes/englishman-river-overnighter/&quot;&gt;Englishman River falls to get in a bit of gravel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That trail was fun, but also got into some pretty narrow and steep singletrack that I wasn‚Äôt ready for on my heavily loaded bike, I had to walk a bunch of it. Then got to the top and found that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/englishman_rv/&quot;&gt;campground was closed&lt;/a&gt;. Normally that would be fine, but the water was turned off and it was a long walk to purify some. It was also an extremely mosquito infested campground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7010049726/embed/1e3b9a2da4660ec3bb670f52b7541087b481edb1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I cycled back down to Parksville and stayed at the &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;gt;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/rathtrevor/&quot;&gt;absolutely amazing Rathtrevor Beach&lt;/a&gt; campsite. It was so much better and glad I got the ride up the trails and then stayed at an amazing campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1932.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point after 60km, 90km and 110km days‚Ä¶ I was glad I was not heading to Cape Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4-parksville-to-salt-spring&quot;&gt;Day 4: Parksville to Salt Spring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7015146276/embed/cbd203b7c1be7748c0e8a0a7a9b25fa34bcec25e&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another lovely day with sun, getting cloudier towards the end, but little rain. This route had its nice bits and it‚Äôs ugly parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Nanoose Bay you have to get on the highway for 5km+. Nanaimo center and south was terrible and there was more highway parts there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you get off the highway, again its a lovely ride through rural Vancouver island. Lovely little communities, few cars and long roads. The ferry from Crofton to Salt Spring is short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really starting to notice how tired my legs were getting at this point. It‚Äôs easy to look at 100km on a fast unladen road bike and think of doing that in 3-4 hours. It‚Äôs harder on a fully laden bike like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Salt Spring I was greeted by my friend and looked forward to some good chats, beer and food. First I had to cycle up to their house over the ridiculous Salt Spring hills (short and steep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-5-salt-spring-to-deep-cove&quot;&gt;Day 5: Salt Spring to Deep Cove&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7019686713/embed/e71beedf61e735a8243e9ec58cb035d28871a110&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; missing from Strava is the first 11+km that I tried to record, but didn‚Äôt. Hey it was 5:00am in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that the best ferry leaves from Fulford Harbour at 6:20am. So I got up at 5am, put the lights on and road across Salt Spring in the dark. At the ferry I had breakfast and sat on the ferry for 2.5 hours as it worked its way via Pender, Maine and Galiano islands over to Tsawwassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route from Tsawwassen to Deep Cove is mostly miserable and riding along River Road is probably the most dangerous and insane thing to do. Just avoid this if you can, but Tsawwassen is extremely hard to get to by bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn‚Äôt rain, at least, but the cycling infrastructure in parts is just so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BC Ferries are awesome for cyclists. Cheap and you don‚Äôt need a reservation. They‚Äôve usually got hot food, or some food. They are great, a real bonus if you are exploring this coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 10 day trip around the North of Vancouver island is going to take some planning and some drops of supplies. I was carrying 5 days of food and couldn‚Äôt really carry much more. It‚Äôs also going to need better weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs and body would have failed me if I‚Äôd done that route. Turns out going from almost zero cycling to over 439km (this trip), along with 56km the day before plus a 10km running race‚Ä¶ tired me out. I came home and did nothing for two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I recommend this route? I‚Äôd avoid doing Salt Spring to Tsawwassen if you can. I wish I‚Äôd cycled back to Nanaimo and taken the ferry to Horseshoe Bay. That part of the trip was so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip had almost no gravel and was all paved. That‚Äôs ok, but I‚Äôd like to get more gravel time in if I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A bike</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-a-bike/"/>
<updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/a-bike</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And of course I can‚Äôt go bike packing without a bike. I‚Äôve got a Cervelo S3 disk, which is a fabulous and fast aero carbon fibre bike. But it‚Äôs designed for races and sprinting. It‚Äôs high geared, can‚Äôt take racks, isn‚Äôt designed for comfort and I worry when I leave it locked up anywhere. I needed something more practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I headed over &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/&quot;&gt;Landyatchz&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent bike shop on Adanac. They are one of the ones I‚Äôd trust in the lower mainland to work on a bike and also build custom frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed was repeated visits over a couple of months to try out their bikes and see what else was available. I really couldn‚Äôt find much in other shops either, so two Landyatchz bikes became the favourite, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/shop/gravel/&quot;&gt;aluminium AB1&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/bike/cb-mkii-blue/&quot;&gt;steel cb mkII&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually wanted the latter, but to get one in my size would have meant waiting to August. Thanks supply chain. So I‚Äôve got the aluminium AB1, in the newer colouring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;New gravel touring bike Saturday &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ES9mfCq7A6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ES9mfCq7A6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andy McKay (@andymckay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andymckay/status/1512880146910375940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice gear range, but using SRAM Rival there‚Äôs only one gear on the front. Hydraulic disk brakes. Mount points absolutely everywhere. It‚Äôs a nice comfortable ride for long days in the saddle. Nice big fat tubeless tyres for off road bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building out the custom build was fun, but again the supply chain problems that are ongoing meant that the choices were rather limited unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways I‚Äôm really happy with the bike and some 600km later it‚Äôs done the job well, coping with gravel, road and everything I‚Äôve thrown at it. The only two downsides so far is that I do wish the gear ratio went beyond 1:1. With all the bags on, it can be hard work getting up some of the bigger hills. Although I made it up everything that was paved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also would like tyres with less rolling resistance for the road. That‚Äôs an easy fix and based on my (perhaps faulty) assumption that I‚Äôd be doing more gravel than tarmac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, loading it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The original gearing on this bike was a 42 chainring on the front and a 11-42 on the back. While I was in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-05-17-second-trip/&quot;&gt;Maui&lt;/a&gt; I really struggled on some steep hills. So I took it to Landyacht and chatted to the mechanics there. Whilst there another person was complaining about the exact same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing long days with lots of gear you need to make life easy on yourself. I changed the front chainring from 42 to 38 before my third trip.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A tracker</title>

<id>https://mckay.pub/tracker</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm planning on travelling in lots of remote places and already do running and hiking in areas not covered by cell phone coverage. It‚Äôs pretty easy to get into those areas when you head off the beaten path in North Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided since I‚Äôm doing some adventuring alone, it might be time to invest in a tracker. There‚Äôs basically two brands out there that I found Garmin and Spot. I‚Äôm kinda allergic to Garmin, because the stuff I‚Äôve bought from them has not worked out well in the past and would avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I went for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/spot-gen4&quot;&gt;Gen 4 Spot&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs the cheapest and simplest and that‚Äôs all I want. It‚Äôs got 4 buttons, you press them and its sends a signal to your contacts. It regularly sends your location to its home base. It‚Äôs powered by 4 AAA batteries, so easy to keep up to charged on long trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/SPOT/media/Products/SPOT-Gen4/SPOT-Gen4.png?ext=.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty simple and I‚Äôve used it around Vancouver so far with no problems. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs going to be an update on this one, unless I get into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs worth noting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/service-plans#spot-gen4-plans&quot;&gt;Spot does have monthly plans&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to the extra costs of activation and a flex plan it quickly works out not much cheaper than an annual plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside is that if you do get into trouble you press the button and wait. There is no way to communicate with anyone. Just press it and hope help comes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; the satellites do not cover Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;
