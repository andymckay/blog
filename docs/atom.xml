<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since curlers were kicked out of the North Shore Winter Club, there are no curling facilities on the North Shore of Vancouver. Currently we have to travel to New Westminster to go curling. Here’s a list of municipalities in Vancouver, population and number of curling clubs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langley,_British_Columbia_(district_municipality)#/media/File:GVRD_Langley_district.svg&quot;&gt;Township of Langley&lt;/a&gt; is a large area, with the city at its centre and a curling club there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With zero curling rinks, Burnaby is a standout, however with curling rinks in Vancouver, New Westminster, Coquitlam and Port Moody, it has curling rinks in every adjoining area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a combined population of 190,410 for West Vancouver, District of North Vancouver and the City of North Vancouver, there are 0 curling rinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this data is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.curling.ca/about-curling/getting-started-in-curling/find-a-curling-centre/&quot;&gt;Curling Canada website&lt;/a&gt; which has several inaccuracies, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glanfordcurling.com/&quot;&gt;Glanford Curling Club&lt;/a&gt; is in Ontario, not Coquitlam sorry Curling Canada, got that one wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://deltathistle.ca/&quot;&gt;Delta Thistle Curling Club&lt;/a&gt; is not listed on the Curling Canada site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nswc.ca/curling.html&quot;&gt;North Shore Winter Club&lt;/a&gt; does not have curling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollyburn.org/nor&quot;&gt;Hollyburn Country Club&lt;/a&gt; does not have curling.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Everyone has already done it</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-22-happened-before/"/>
<updated>2023-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/happened-before</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my new phase of work, I’m not trying to build a startup. I’m trying to do fun things that can solve problems, I get to learn new things and hopefully along the way be of value to some people. In the last few days I’ve ditched a couple of ideas (will blog about why in a bit). As I go through ideas, I’m reminded of one simple rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has already done everything”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to build a cool product? Someone has already done it. Somewhere, sometime, maybe even now, maybe many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. In fact, at its most simple level its validation that the thing you are planning to build has a market and has users. It means that the market exists. Perhaps they got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firstmover.asp&quot;&gt;first mover advantage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t mean you can’t do it: faster, cheaper, or whatever you need to make it happen. Don’t be intimidated by others in your space, research what they’ve done and then go do it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before GitHub there was Sourceforge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Google there was Altavista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Altavista there was Yahoo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and before before ChatGPT there was Google (just a bit of snark there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or as Battlestar Galactica put it “All of this has happened before and will happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href=&quot;https://consumerist.com/2007/12/29/want-a-thriving-coffee-shop-open-next-to-a-starbucks/&quot;&gt;Want a Thriving Coffee Shop? Open Next to A Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No marathons this year</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-15-no-marathon/"/>
<updated>2023-02-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/no-marathon</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last 3 years my goal has to be do marathons and also long 160km+ bike races. But I’ve noticed this has produced a pattern in my behaviour that I’d like to break. The goal marathon for me has been the Vancouver BMO Marathon in May and we start training in January. So my years goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;January: I’m unfit and I’ve eaten too much, time to get into shape and train.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;February: Ugh, the worst time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;March: I’m doing 20km training runs and feeling good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;April: I’m doing 30km training runs and feeling great. I’m not cycling enough and the cycling clubs have started.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May: Marathon. Marathons hurt, why am I doing this? I hate it. I’m falling behind on cycling. My legs hurt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June: &lt;strong&gt;I hate running, I’m never running again.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m behind on cycling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;July: &lt;strong&gt;I hate running, I’m never running again.&lt;/strong&gt; I can’t catch up with the cyclists. I’m off my diet and gaining weight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;August: Wow the mountains are amazing I’m going hiking. Forget running and cycling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;September: Big bike races. I hate cycling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;October, November, December: I’ve failed at cyling and running and I’m in a funk. Only 3 months till the cycle starts again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I peak at the marathon, it ruins my legs and I stop running. The running bites into my cycling and I fail at that. The thing is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve not gotten to the point where marathons aren’t destroying me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Running and cycling both take up lots of time to train a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My motivation drops off a cliff after the marathon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I actually enjoy the marathon training, 20-30km distances feel good and I can feel the improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see my fitness change here 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/fitness-2023.png&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those circles are the BMO Marathon and the Whistler Fondo respectively. You can see the build up before hand, the inconsistency inbetween and then the drop at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I’m going to try to be more balanced and see if I can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just do half marathons, but increase my time regularly instead of aiming for longer distances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be more balanced, with cycling, running, weights and hiking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve and maintain a base level of fitness instead of feeling like I have to climb out of a hole every winter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe a triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Django - still awesome</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-09-django-still-awesome/"/>
<updated>2023-02-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I first started using Django in 2008. That’s forever ago in internet terms, as a I left Zope and Plone for something better. Later on I got a job at Mozilla doing Django full time, but then became a Manager and then moved on. I haven’t written Django for anything more than quick side projects for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the last couple of weeks I’ve stood up a couple of projects on Django. Honestly its been an experience in learning and remembering how this stuff works. It’s been a lot of fun. I’ve stood up two Django sites since then and it’s as I remember, just better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of making exciting things with boring technology and after all this time Django is one of those “boring” technologies that just works really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still a fan and that’s a credit to the people and the community that have kept Django going. Well done to all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still prefer to Rails 😀&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Actions, IPv6 and Fly.io</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-08-actions-ipv6/"/>
<updated>2023-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/actions-ipv6</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stood up a service on fly.io as a subdomain of an existing site. You can do this by adding a CNAME record to your DNS pointing to the fly.io instance. In this case &lt;a href=&quot;https://clearwind.ca&quot;&gt;clearwind.ca&lt;/a&gt; is managed on Google Domains and currently points to GitHub pages site. Then &lt;a href=&quot;https://notifications.clearwind.ca&quot;&gt;notifications.clearwind.ca&lt;/a&gt; is a fly.io instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do this on the dashboard, you’ll get a page that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/flyio-ipv6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added it all in, waited for DNS to update and it all worked. However, when I tried to hit using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; in GitHub Action, I kept hitting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Connecting to notifications.clearwind.ca (notifications.clearwind.ca)|2a09:8280:1::db06|:443... failed: Network is unreachable.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s correctly resolved the IPv6 domain, so I wasn’t quite sure what the problem was. I couldn’t spot anything in the Actions documentation. In the end it was simple as adding in the IPv4 address for the domain. That isn’t shown on the fly.io dashboard, but you can find it in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IP addresses&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case adding in an A name to that IP address fixed the issue and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; worked as expected. Why fly.io is doing this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.fly.io/t/announcement-shared-anycast-ipv4/9384&quot;&gt;covered here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New blog - Beyond cars</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-07-new-blog/"/>
<updated>2023-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/new-blog</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This blog has been around for 16 years, which is just wierd. Most of the time I’ve focused on tech ramblings. But over that time things have changed significantly for me. These days I want to put in a lot of energy for arguing against cars, car dependency and advocating for other solutions in our cities. As such I’m going to move all that to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://beyondcars.ca&quot;&gt;new blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited by this, over the years I’ve built up a huge list of articles that I’d like to work on and dig more deeply into some important subjects with a Canadian and Vancouver angle on them. I want to do a lot of advocacy in this area and this is just one of the ways I’ll be doing it. As a result this blog will hopefully become just more focused on technical stuff, because I really need to get back into blogging about some of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways there’s a new blog here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://beyondcars.ca&quot;&gt;Beyond Cars&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hachyderm.io/@beyondcars&quot;&gt;Mastodon account&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What's next</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-03-whats-next/"/>
<updated>2023-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/whats-next</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, for the last few years I worked at GitHub as part of an amazing team building &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;. I got to work on stuff that really did change how people build software. I was there from the re-invention after it’s announcement (there were earlier days) until early 2022. I was immensely proud of Actions. When people ask what I’ve done in my career, the two biggest product achievements remain: moving Firefox over to WebExtensions and building GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last year it was time for a change. GitHub were kind enough to give me a extended holiday to think about things, hence all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/tags/trips/&quot;&gt;2022 trips&lt;/a&gt;. I came back and worked with the wonderful Dependabot team for a while, but alas it wasn’t to be and I voluntarily moved on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vercel&quot;&gt;Vercel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That next thing was &lt;a href=&quot;https://vercel.com/&quot;&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt; which I was excited about, moving to a smaller company focused on some things that I thought were interesting. However a few months later, it turns out that wasn’t the place for me and I chose to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to get into the details of why Vercel didn’t work out for me, but suffice to say that the cultural fit was missing, along with a few other things. There’s some really good people at Vercel building some very good stuff and I wish them only the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timing&quot;&gt;Timing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could timing be any worse? At the same time as I decide to leave Vercel so many other people around the technology world are also being laid off. It’s tough for so many people right now, but finding a full time job (that doesn’t suck) right now is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone having to do that 💚 and if I can help at all, please drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times like this its important to remember that organisations and the jobs are temporary. The people, the relationships and the connections are what last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I’m not looking for another full time job at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-my-roots&quot;&gt;Back to my roots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before GitHub, there was Mozilla and before Mozilla there was open source work at a few different places. There was Plone (which is still going) and Django (still awesome) and Python (still my favourite language).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days had young daughters, was just starting my career and learning so much that it was tough. I quickly had to take jobs to pay the bills, do consulting and the thought of going a month without income was really hard and stressful. I’m sure many of you can relate to this 😢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these days thanks to places like Mozilla and GitHub (and Microsoft for buying GitHub) the situation is different. I’m more secure financially and that gives me the freedom to do what I want in a work situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so&quot;&gt;So…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this as an amazing opportunity in life that I haven’t had before. So over the next while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primarily: &lt;strong&gt;I’ll be focusing on missions I care about, the environment, cycling etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll be aiming to build some projects and products.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consulting, advising and supporting where I can.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoiding on-call rotations, because they are the worst.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spending a lot of time working on my running, cycling and hiking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blogging a lot more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connecting more with people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, it’s all about the mission and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m not looking for work right now, unless it’s something super awesome or special or I get to work closely with someone amazing from my past 👋 If so, drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No we don't need a third bridge</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-01-30-third-bridge/"/>
<updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/third-bridge</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems odd that we’d have to say this, but we don’t need a third bridge to Vancouver in North Vancouver. Yet apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsnews.com/opinion/almost-two-thirds-of-north-shore-readers-say-a-new-bridge-is-needed-6423723&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; suggests that two thirds of readers say they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-the-easy-choice&quot;&gt;It’s the easy choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s people in cars everywhere, we build roads, bridges and car parks and so on. When you see traffic congestion it’s simple to just want to build more infrastructure. Build more roads and bridges and the traffic will get better right? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember this is the community that has seen $250 million invested in the interchange at Mountain Highway and traffic has just gotten worse and worse since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easy choice is the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-would-it-actually-go&quot;&gt;Where would it actually go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/options.png&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-six-possible-routes-for-rapid-transit-across-burrard-inlet&quot;&gt;This article discusses some routes&lt;/a&gt; and breaks them down into bridges and tunnels. The tunnels are all around Stanley Park, because no-one wants to knock the tress down in the park. Well some people do, but let’s assumes that’s politically unpalatble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridges are all around Second Narrows, because it’s a shorter and easier bridge to build with some houses and industrial land on either side. Industrial land is much easier to rezone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a tunnel! There have been so many tunnels proposed, but it’s really expensive and hard. Burrard Inlet gets to 66m deep. If you build a tunnel, you have to build the infrastructure to get to it, which brings to my next point…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-would-it-need-on-either-side&quot;&gt;What would it need on either side?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand around the Second Narrows? On the north side you hit the highway going north and the “cut” which is constrained to a couple of lanes each way. There isn’t really room to grow there. Highway 1 is 2 to 3 lanes across the North Shore, so widening that would require a vast re-allocation of land. On the south side you hit Cassiar tunnel which is going to be really hard and expensive to expand and then it goes on through the rest of Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand around Lions Gate? At the south end you’ll just drop a pile of traffic into downtown, because downtown isn’t struggling with too many cars already. On the north side the traffic currently goes left, towards Park Royal or right towards Marine Drive. Neither of which can take more load, so those will need changing and possibly build more of a highway up to Highway 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the middle, near the Seabus? So how would the traffic get there? Would we have to turn Lonsdale into a highway to connect up Highway 1? Where on earth would a highway landing in East Vancouver go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you increase the bridge capacity, you have to increase the capacity around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-cheaper-than-transit&quot;&gt;It’s cheaper than transit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of the Skytrain is roughly $500 million per km for the Broadway Skytrain construction. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I’m no expert but that seems really expensive, but I’m not an expert on why it costs that much.  A suggested line across the North Shore and then to downtown at 20km could be roughly in the $10 billion price range. But it’s probably more expensive due to the bridge. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of the Massey Tunnel replacement is $4.15 billion, the suggested bridge replacement was $2.7 billion. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not really worth trying to compare a 20km rapid transit line to a bridge that is 629m long, but let’s be clear: road infrastructure is expensive to build, expensive to maintain &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and involves zero user fees. Don’t be fooled that it’s cheap to build or maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way out of this problem, for many reasons I haven’t covered, including climate change, accessibility, climate change, health, increasing density and so on is to increase our investments in alternative forms of transport. From active transport like cycling to public transit like buses and trains. No city has solved this by building more bridges. And it will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/portland.png&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really want to live in a place like that (sorry Portland)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saddest part of the article “less than 18 per cent – indicated they’d need more information to have an informed opinion on the topic.”. It’s not just that people have this opinion, it’s that they don’t want to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>North Vancouver District - 2022 Elections</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-10-13-nvandistrict/"/>
<updated>2022-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/nvandistrict</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I will be voting on the weekend: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mrmathewbond/&quot;&gt;Matthew Bond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jordanback&quot;&gt;Jordan Back&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jimhanson_nv&quot;&gt;Jim Hanson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/globalpope&quot;&gt;Catherine Pope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ellisonmallin&quot;&gt;Ellison Mallin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/harrison4nv&quot;&gt;Harrison Johnston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because we need change in North Vancouver District and the existing council have repeatedly failed to produce this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Vancouver, there are two big intertwined issues, transportation and housing. The majority of residents living in North Vancouver work somewhere else, the majority of people working in the North Vancouver live somewhere else. That’s because house prices here are so high and everyone has to come into the district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These candidates seem to understand the problems that exist in the district and want to bring change and improvements. We can’t keep having single family homes across the district that no-one can afford to buy. We can’t keep increasing investment in cars and car infrastructure because it doesn’t solve anything, induced demand just keeps bringing more cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best time to invest in active forms of transport was years. The second best time to do it is now. Specifically candidates who said things like “I cycled to this meeting along the Seymour Parkway, and let me tell you its not pleasant” will get my vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who I listened to and won’t vote for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Little, Lisa Muri and Betty Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Betty Forbes is the person who got on council to ban pigeons, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/north-van-pigeons-betty-forbes-1.5964869&quot;&gt;because her neighbour has one&lt;/a&gt;. She thinks that cycling &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikehub.ca/municipal-elections/northvandistrict&quot;&gt;is well funded&lt;/a&gt; and suggested that building more parking lots and having bus shuttles will reduce traffic. Yep, more parking to have less cars. So pretty clueless on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s Mike Little’s opinion on cyclists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NVanDistrict?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@NVanDistrict&lt;/a&gt; incumbent Mayor Mike Little: if cyclists really cared about safety, they’d look like motorcyclists, with their protective clothing. But our cyclists won’t even go one block out of their way! They want to be on the main drag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just doesn’t get it. Vote accordingly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/B3zUZREgR5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/B3zUZREgR5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Martyn Schmoll (@martynschmoll) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/martynschmoll/status/1580589310973480960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His opinion on traffic is that he’s working on a business plan for skytrain (sometime in the next ten years) and a replacement for the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge. So in twenty years Mike might bring some change to the District. Maybe, but in the meantime it’s all cyclists fault. I’ll go tell my daughter to go buy motorcycle gear and stay out of the way of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa Muri is confusing, because she’s extremely good at talking and confusing the issue. But when I’ve listened to her I found undertones of being obstructionist, unhelpful and blaming others. Lisa has been a councillor for 25+ years and plays politics well - if you don’t want anything to change in North Vancouver she’s your candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Teevan? Well a life long worker in finance at automative dealerships wants to build a 6 lane each way multi level replacement to the Ironworkers Memorial bridge. One more lane will fix it, bro.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Valley Fondo, Cowichan Crusher and Penticton Fondo</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-07-14-some-bike-races/"/>
<updated>2022-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/some-bike-races</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some of the bike races I did this year, so far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;valley-fondo&quot;&gt;Valley Fondo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I registered for the this Fondo in 2020 so my registration was a roll-over from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally this starts in the middle of Fort Langley, but this time it started in a muddy field nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7255284868&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this race tough for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I forgot to take pills that control my heart rate and so had to stop a couple of times&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My back started to hurt really early in the race and didn’t get better&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I got some good drafts, but struggled on hills and lost groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I find the race goes around nice parts of the valley. But I struggled to get a real sense of where I was, where I was going and so on. It just felt like I was cycling around in circles (I was). I was extremely glad that this race finished quite short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d probably not do this race again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cowichan-crusher&quot;&gt;Cowichan Crusher&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I registered for this at the last minute and made it into a camping trip and did 120km the day before to get there. Most of the information is over in &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2022-06-07-south-vancouver-island/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. It’s nice to do a gravel race for a change and I wasn’t aiming for anything good here, just to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;okanagan-fondo&quot;&gt;Okanagan Fondo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another hold over from 2020, this is my second time doing this Fondo. It happens to fall the day after my birthday and I really enjoy the Okanagan. After my experience in the Valley Fondo and my complete lack of cycling with Steed this year, I expected to go into this one and struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7448317184&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out I didn’t struggle this time. My back didn’t hurt until about 140km or so, usual for a long bike ride. My heart stayed under control and the weather was good. All the way south I was able to get into good groups and share pulling with some good drafts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was saving some energy for the hill at 110km, because that totally destroyed me last time and after that I was spent. Not so this time, it was tough, but nowhere as near as bad as I remembered. It did cause my average speed to drop below 32km/h, but as I approached and passed the observatory, I was able to start increasing my average speed above 30km a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I started realising I could land this in under 5 hours, at an average pace over 30km/h… and I did hitting PRs on most of the route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one felt good and I’d love to come back and do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Sixth Trip - Mt. Frosty</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-07-14-mt-frosty/"/>
<updated>2022-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/mt-frosty</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Sunday I competed in my second Okanagan Gran Fondo. It was really good and I improved greatly on my time from last year, chopping off almost 30 minutes and completing my first Fondo at over 30km an hour. On Sunday my wife dropped me off in Manning Park on the way home so I could climb Mt. Frosty, the tallest peak in Manning Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-windy-joe&quot;&gt;Day 1: Windy Joe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11.92km, 685m elevation, 5hr 19min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked up to Windy Joe and then out to the Pacific Crest Trail campsite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7463885716&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windy Joe is a cool old fire lookout station on top of a hill. It was a nice hike, but there are many, many logs across the paths and navigating them with a backpack is a challenge. It was also hot hitting 35c around midday according to our thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So normally it wouldn’t be challenging but with the heat and logs, we were happy to camp in what turned out to be a beautiful spot with a fabulous view up the valley towards Mt Frosty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3585.JPG&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;The hut on top of Windy Joe&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3591.JPG&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;We are heading up that mountain tomorrow&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-mt-frosty&quot;&gt;Day 2: Mt Frosty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;11.88km, 1,011m elevation, 8hr 7min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the big one, up and over &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosty_Mountain&quot;&gt;Mt Frosty&lt;/a&gt;, at 2,426m the tallest mountain in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/ecmanning/&quot;&gt;Manning Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7463886069&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail just goes up continually without almost any breaks, up into the alpine and snow. We had stunning hot weather and amazing views every single way as plants bloomed in the alpine. Parts of the trail were obscured by snow, so we put spikes on, got the poles out and hiked up the side of the mountain as it got windier and windier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view from the top is just amazing and every time I hike mountains like this, I find no matter what pictures I take, they are completely inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top there’s a path across the ridge to the top, or down to the campsite. So we dropped bags and headed up to the top for the view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3639.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Top is up there&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3649.png&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Top of Mt. Frosty&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming down was a lot of snow on the other side as we made our way down the to the campsite for the night. We all got sunburnt and wowed at the views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3-frosty-creek-camp&quot;&gt;Day 3: Frosty Creek Camp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;9.69km, 2hr 33min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camp at Frosty Creek is ok, but you can tell this side of the mountain is more popular and gets more visitors as it wasn’t in as good shape. Anyway this is a short and lovely hike down into the valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7463885584&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always ❤️ coming down into the valley after a hike up a mountain, the thick air with lush vegetation full of animals. It’s just such a contrast to being on the top of a windswept mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3664.JPG&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Lightening Lakes&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fantastic hike that just caused me a bit of anxiety because I’m not great with heights and being on top of windblown ridge with deadly drops on either side isn’t my happy place. Some people do this in one day, in fact one of our party did when she ran the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raceroster.com/events/2022/57012/frosty-mountain-50k-27k-and-13k&quot;&gt;Frosty Mountain race&lt;/a&gt;. I think anyone who does that is bad ass. I was happy to do it at a leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that now I’ve got a clearly defined set of gear it was super easy to pack, go through my checklist and get going on a hike, so that’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fantastic way to end my sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fifth trip - West Coast Trail</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-25-west-coast-trail/"/>
<updated>2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/west-coast-trail</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/activ/SCO-WCT&quot;&gt;West Coast Trail&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular hiking trips in the world and has for many years been a rite of passage for many people in BC. In June I noticed that a spot was available - they normally all get booked for the year as soon as the reservations open in January - and took it. Heading from the south to the north on June 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of spending the weeks cycling or running I focused on hiking with a back pack, doing my usual local trails with varying weights of backpacks and also doing the &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-06-25-stein-valley/&quot;&gt;Stein Valley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d read lots of posts about the trail and the toll the 75km takes on people. Over 100 people are year are evacuated usually due to hypothermia or injuries from slipping. The weeks leading up to the trip were mostly full of anxiety… would I be fit enough, would I have the right gear and so on. I went full on as &lt;a href=&quot;/2022-06-25-packing-light/&quot;&gt;light as possible&lt;/a&gt;, was this a bad move? We’d find out. Oh and I was doing it solo, the most dangerous way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcweb.azureedge.net/-/media/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/WET4/visit/PDF/2019-WCT-Map_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;Map of the trail as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry, this is a long one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-there&quot;&gt;Getting there&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me leaving a car at Port Renfrew or Bamfield wasn’t option. Port Renfrew has paved access, Bamfield is accessible only by logging road. The two main options are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ladyrosemarine.com/schedule-rates&quot;&gt;Bamfield ferry to Port Alberni&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trailbus.com/&quot;&gt;Trail Bus&lt;/a&gt;. I took the bus from Victoria to the start and they picked me up at Bamfield and took me back to Nanaimo. The bus was cool, but its a bus on logging roads, you’ll get a comfier ride on the ferry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;direction&quot;&gt;Direction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a note that I had no choice in direction. The two main ways are north to south or south to north. Options from Nitinaht are available, which is basically in the middle. The hardest parts of the trail are by far the sections from Walbran Creek south. Specifically the section to the west of Camper Bay and east of Camper Bay to Gordon River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing south 👉 north, you do the hardest parts first. If you are doing north 👉 south, you will do the hardest parts last. Some say, its better to save the hardest part to last since you will have eaten food and have a lighter pack. I was happy I did south to north and got the tough stuff done while fresh, it just got easier every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-one-gordon-river-to-camper-bay&quot;&gt;Day one: Gordon River to Camper Bay&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;13.35km in 5h 33min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus deposited us at the entrance to the park. A bunch of nervous hikers all checking out each others backpacks and asking how long they’ll take and so on. A really nice person gave us an orientation and talked us through the video. For the route you’ll need to keep a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pcweb.azureedge.net/-/media/pn-np/bc/pacificrim/WET4/visit/PDF/2019-WCT-Map_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;map on hand&lt;/a&gt; and have a list of the tide times. A lot of trail is on the beach and you’ll need to know what the tide is (they give you this, don’t lose it). This means you will also need a device that tells you the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the chatter was about how small my backpack and was how light it was. At this point I wasn’t quite sure if I was just completely stupid for going so small and light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park ranger told us that the first campsite Thrasher takes most people 4 hours to get to - it’s only 5km away. The next campsite Camper Bay takes another 4 hours to get to. They then got into details about going from Thrasher to Camper Bay by see - it involves a boulder field that takes about 3 hours and then dangerous cliffs and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of this seemed to be an exercise in caution, understanding the map and tides. I imagine that the rangers have to deal with people of all abilities on this trail and they have to deal with pulling people out when it goes wrong, a tough job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the start you have to take a ferry and at about 10:30am I was off, on the West Coast Trail, solo  - the most dangerous way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the river you are faced with a vertical ladder to scale. The first of many and telling of what is to come:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020717.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;This is the start. Get used to it.&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me 2 and a bit hours to get to the junction to Thrashers. I was hiking at my usual comfortable speed I was doing in North Vancouver and overtaking people who started on the 8am ferry. It felt comfortable for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362981527&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I would end up at Thrashers at 1pm ish and have an entire day to wait for tides to go around the coast. And I’d have to wait in the morning for the tides again. That would get me to Campers on day 2. I’m not good at waiting around and the boulder field and only part of the map marked “Very dangerous” didn’t appeal. Plus, I really wanted to ensure I finished on schedule… the day after the West Coast Trail is my daughters graduation, I promised not to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pushed on to Camper Bay and got there in two and a bit hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020722.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;So many broken bridges and boardwalks. This coast is tough on infrastructure.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail Gordon River to Thrashers felt like a hike on the more remote North Vancouver trails (eg: Three chop, upper lynn loop etc). Just throw in a bunch of ladders. Thrashers to Camper Bay was a muddy hell hole of broken boardwalks, mud, deep mud, slippy everything and mud. Parts of this were not that much fun. People I chatted to later said the boulder field on the coast wasn’t fun either so 🤷‍♂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I took the cable car across and camped at Camper Bay for the night. Met a nice group from Alberta who let me share their camp fire. Mostly we spoke about how I managed to do it so fast, when some of their group took over 6 hours to get to Thrashers 🤷‍♂. The advantage of doing this kind of trail regularly and having a super light backpack I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-two-camper-bay-to-bonilla-point&quot;&gt;Day two: Camper Bay to Bonilla Point&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16.8km in 7h 24min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the sun rose, I staggered out of bed, made my tea and oats and packed up. First one out on the trail up north. For this day there were multiple places I could camp, it was more about where I wanted to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362981573&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The section out of Camper Bay continued the trend of being broken boardwalks, mud, bog, ladders, rivers, bridges, ladders, more ladders, mud and so on. Did I mention mud? There’s a lot of that. When you get to Walbran Creek, it mud comes to and end you was able to exit from the forest onto the beach for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020736.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;So many ladders and its hard to get a feel of how steep they are from these pictures.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still felt good at this point, strong and powering through things. I will admit, I did find some of the ladders a bit scary at times. Heights aren’t my thing and having a backpack and poles etc makes it harder. Doing some of those in pouring rain, with heavy backpacks must be hard. Camper Bay to Walbran is rough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020754.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Coming out of the forest onto the beach felt pretty good.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had lunch at Walbran Creek and tried to cross - silly idea. I got my feet and gaiters totally drenched and was only half way across when it got really deep. So I back tracked and went across the creek using the cable car higher up. But that gave me the excuse to have a cup of tea, change socks and dry things out a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that it was gorgeous beach walking for a while. I stopped at Bonilla Point to camp because its cute, has a waterfall and was deserted. And it stayed that way, being the only person there all night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind, not all beach walking is easy. The sand is at an angle and often very soft so you slip a lot. You’ll also be climbing over rocks, seaweed, rock shelves and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night the weather closed it and we got wet west coast mist for many hours, so I hid in the tent most of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-three-bonilla-point-to-tsusiat-falls&quot;&gt;Day three: Bonilla Point to Tsusiat Falls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;25.24km in 9h 52min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsusiat Falls is one of the most popular camping sites on the West Coast Trail. It marks a destination for hikers from the north. For them its the last site before a long trek to Cribbs through an area that’s low in water and has no formal campsites. Similarly from the south, once you go past Cribbs there isn’t anything much till Tsusiat. You can camp &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; anywhere, but there is a 5km or so stretch between the two with no camping due to animal activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I headed out with some damp gear, but nothing too bad from last night heading. Cribbs was really close to Bonilla and I went through there at 9:30am, so I wasn’t going to stop there. This was pretty much all on the beach and easy hiking as the sun started to work it’s way through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362981605&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail alternated with little bits inland and the beach before inland towards Nitinaht. I was feeling pretty good here still and powering along quite happily. Views were getting better and the trails were improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020782.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;I wish every hike was this beautiful.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Nitinaht ferry there’s the Crabshack which serves crabs and other delicacies like bags of chips and pop. I went for a grill cheese which took 40 minutes, but was worth it. A quick ferry ride across the river led me on to the trail so I could keep powering towards Tsusiat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the trail is high up on a cliff, close to the edge with fantastic views. And here I met my first bear. It saw me first and darted at 90% to me across the trail. I quickly saw 2 cubs shoot up a tree. I backed of and fumbled for my bear spray shouting “Bear” at the top of my voice to warn others and something to make noise to keep the bear aware of where I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 4 minutes of not seeing any bear and shouting until I felt like an idiot, I inched forward, bear spray at the ready. It was long gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020816.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;One of the many random beaches without people on that you see from the trail. Just amazing.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of hike to Tsusiat was uneventful, but getting even more pretty including a cool sea arch that I only just made the tides for. That night I was surrounded by tons of people but the waterfall and sea meant I didn’t hear much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020837.JPG&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Tents and waterfall at Tsusiat.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-four-tsusiat-falls-to-michigan-creek&quot;&gt;Day four: Tsusiat Falls to Michigan Creek&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;12.64km in 5h 14min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the number of campsites is limited, Michigan Creek is the last formal campsite. Darling River campsite is closed due to bear activity, so Michigan seemed like the best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362981453&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a combination of beach and trail up on the cliffs. Probably one of the most scenic sections with views down to the rocks and bluffs and beaches. Some serious ladders and a bit of mud, but overall the trail is really good at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsocowis Creek is a lovely spot with a nice campsite that had no one there. I stopped, put up the hammock and had a good nap. The hike to Michigan Creek is along the beach with a couple of streams to ford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiking was pretty easy and I still felt good, able to power along and got to Michigan Creek in the early afternoon. I spent a while failing to set up my hammock, none of the trees were quite right. Finally settled on a spot in the trees with my tent and chilled… only to find I’d lost my camera &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Aargh. I knew the last time I used it was Tsocowis Creek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020869.JPG&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Bridge over waterfall at Tsocowis Creek.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After ages searching the campground, asking people and retracing my steps I was at a loss. So I grabbed my Spot, my bear spray and hiked the 9km return to Tsocowis Creek to see if it was there. It wasn’t. So really I did 21km+ this day, but 9km of it was in the sun without a backpack - nice and easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that night someone found the camera next to their tent. Yay 😃&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3472.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Evening at Michigan Creek&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-five-michigan-creek-to-pachena-access&quot;&gt;Day five: Michigan Creek to Pachena Access&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;12.62km in 3h 24min&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can probably tell the times are getting shorter and shorter for similar distances. The differences in the trail, the quality of the infrastructure and the quality of the trail is like night and day. If the first day is a hike on the hardest North shore trail, this is a walk on Stanley Park. It’s mostly in great condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7362971051&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another bear sighting, which ran off quickly once it spotted me. Sea lion rock is awesome and is a few rocks full of sea lions. Was as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020881.JPG&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Sea lion rock is loud and fun to watch.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few hours I turned up at the beautiful beach at Pachena and I was done at 12:30pm, one day early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/P1020891.JPG&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;The end at Pachena beach.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trail bus crew were able to move my reservation up a day and by 5:30pm I was in Nanaimo waiting for a ferry home and kinda wishing I was able to turn back and do the whole trail once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trail is beautiful&lt;/strong&gt; in that special west coast way, similar to Haida Gwaii and so on. Long empty beaches, bears, eagles, ravens, sea otters and just continuous beauty. I hope I never get tired this amazing coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trail is muddy&lt;/strong&gt; beyond anyway I thought possible. It’s really bad and that makes it really slippy. It’s what makes the trail harder and I can’t imagine how bad it is in the rain. You need gaiters and poles for the mud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficulty is subjective&lt;/strong&gt;. I didn’t find it that hard, because I’ve spent years hiking on the North Shore and it is similar to the harder trails. If you don’t do this kind of hiking regularly, if you’ve got a big backpack you will find it &lt;strong&gt;very tough&lt;/strong&gt;. I think back to the experience some people had said they had hiking (almost none) and their backpack weight (very heavy) on the bus to the trail and cringe, I hope they made it in the time they had allotted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light is better&lt;/strong&gt; when it comes to backpacking. The majority of accidents are people slipping and if you are fatigued from carrying a 60lb backpack and trying to negotiate this trail, you are more likely to have a serious slip. I didn’t feel I missed anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s more sanitised than I expected&lt;/strong&gt;. I did go 4 hours at a time without seeing people and I did camp by myself. But those were the exceptions, it’s become quite popular and all the rivers have bridges or cable cars. There is support and exit points if you have an accident and that’s all good. But I’m craving something more remote, maybe the North Coast trail, Haida Gwaii etc. The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this hike and my time on the trail so much and I missed it as soon as I was done. I would do it again. Those last three days in the sun were amazing and I ❤️ this part of the world, so very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3486.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;Felt good to be done and now I can get to a hot shower and my daughters graduation. And maybe a beer.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👋 I’ll be back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I used an old camera for pictures. This meant I could leave my phone off and only use it for emergencies and not have to carry a battery pack. This was much lighter and worked well. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Fourth Trip - Stein Valley</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-25-stein-valley/"/>
<updated>2022-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/stein-valley</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite places in BC is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/stein_val/&quot;&gt;Stein Valley Nlaka’pamux Heritage Park&lt;/a&gt;, located by Lytton, BC. It’s special for a couple of reasons. It’s one of the only large unlogged watersheds &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein_River&quot;&gt;left in BC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s much warmer than everywhere else, making it ideal for trips when you want to avoid rain, or weather elsewhere is crappy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The park is big, with one main trail that comes in from the west side of the Fraser River and goes up to the Stein Lake, 50km+ away. This means there is really only one main trail and route in the park with not many options until you get up to the lake. Once you get up the lake passes and trails exist through over to the west to Blowdown Creek etc. This is serious alpine wilderness hiking, which unfortunately I haven’t been able to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plan was to head up for three days and enjoy the weather. It was also a trial for the West Coast Trail trip as I haven’t back packed in a while… instead using a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-one-heading-up-the-stein&quot;&gt;Day one: heading up the Stein&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entry to the Stein means going through Lytton and seeing first hand the devastation of the heat dome last year. The scarred and twisted remains of the centre of the town are just heartbreaking. It’s no exaggeration to say that the town is just gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the Stein you can take the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/passenger-travel/water-travel/inland-ferries/lytton-reaction-ferry&quot;&gt;reaction ferry&lt;/a&gt; across the river. Except because of flooding and high snow melt, the ferry was closed. The ramp to get onto the ferry was flooded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7293015309&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two choices left; the rail bridge to the south of Lytton and then an 8km hike up to the park trailhead or the suspension bridge and a ~2km hike. We went for the latter. It looks like this and with a 30km+ wind howling up the Fraser it made an interesting crossing while carrying a large backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_3377.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the hike was pretty straightforward, beautiful forests by a raging river. Pictographs carved on rock and lots of camping sites in 28c sunny weather, sounds pretty good to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We camped at Devils Staircase campground, which isn’t a staircase and isn’t really hard or devilish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-two-leaving-the-stein&quot;&gt;Day two: leaving the Stein&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan for day two was to head further into the Stein, without our backpacks. We set off heading north and hit a snag. About 1km north of the campground the trail is badly washed out with a gully of death leading right down to the river.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was seriously steep, seriously sketchy and with a very large penalty if you slipped. I just wasn’t comfortable crossing, I tried and nearly lost it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at that point, we headed back, packed up and reluctantly headed out of the Stein Valley and found a gin and tonic instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;strava-embed-placeholder&quot; data-embed-type=&quot;activity&quot; data-embed-id=&quot;7293015342&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out in almost 30c heat, hiking up hills with 40lb+ backpacks and crossing the suspension bridge of doom was enough to wipe us out. Getting back to the car, we definitely felt like we’d done a good hike and we enjoyed our gin and tonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have the ambition to get to the Stein Lake and do the Stein Valley traverse, ideally by crossing over from Blowdown Creek or Lizzie Pass. But not this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
