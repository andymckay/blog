<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my first trip I needed to loaded up my bike with gear. This is going to be a continual learning process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my bike full loaded on my first trip:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1913.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I didn’t go the usual bike packing way of a large handlebar bag and a behind the seat bag for a few reasons. I found most of the handlebar bags quite restrictive - they take up a lot of space where my hands would normally go. I found that extremely wierd. I’ve ridden with a rack and saddle bags for ages, I find it comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’m probably going to be doing more bike touring than bike packing and I’m rarely going to be doing anything too technical and mountain bike like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mec.ca/en/product/6000-588/Nano-X-Hail-Dry-Bag?colour=Zinnia&quot;&gt;MEC 5L dry bags&lt;/a&gt; on the front&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-full-frame-pack/&quot;&gt;middle frame bag from Apidura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apidura.com/shop/expedition-full-frame-pack/&quot;&gt;panniers from MEC&lt;/a&gt; that I stole from my wife’s bag. In there was another MEC dry bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One dry bag that we had lying around on the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dividing everything up logically I was then able to pack this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleeping back and thermals in one of the front dry bags.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most of my remaining clothes in the other front dry bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleeping mat in the dry bag lying on the top of the rack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One dry bag containing all other things that should stay dry in one pannier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tent in the other pannier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food and all heavy stuff in the middle frame bag.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remaining stuff (fuel, stove, pots, first aid kit, rope etc) distributed around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seemed to work well, although I made a few changes as I went along:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I ended up with a few heavy things in the sleeping mat bag. This meant they slid to the back of the bike and caused it to be unstable when standing or cornering. I moved them into the frame bag to be directly over the bottom bracket and that helped a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I found a few things I needed quickly on a cold wet ride: hats, buffs, waterproofs. I quickly redistributed these to places I could get them quickly. The dry bags on the front forks were ideal for just one or two things at the top like this. Quick and easy to get in and out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The panniers had two big flaws, I’m looking for replacements. They aren’t fully waterproof (as the website says). They are fine for short journeys, but 8+hrs of cycling in the rain… no. The velcro can open up when they are overloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The frame bag got quickly disorganised because its so big. I need to find a way to organise it better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall once I got the weight distribution better, it worked out well. Until I took a bikepacking.com route and ended up on trails that are just not designed for me with panniers. But it was still fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1935.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;The bike was not gonna fit down some of these parts of the trail.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>First trip</title>

<updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/first-trip</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;All right, so this first trip is a bit of an odd one in that I wanted to do an overnight or more trip to test everything out. Make sure I liked cycling long distances followed by camping. I wanted to do it locally, but the weather really wasn’t co-operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to back home for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bmovanmarathon.ca/&quot;&gt;my marathon&lt;/a&gt; so I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com&quot;&gt;bikepacking.com&lt;/a&gt; and picked a route that seemed hard (but maybe doable) but also had a good plan B option if it didn’t work out. So I looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com/routes/tree-to-sea-loop-vancouver-island/&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and said “why not?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get to the start of this ride is a multi-day ride. This was an ambitious choice that wasn’t going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-deep-cove-to-sechelt&quot;&gt;Day 1: Deep cove to Sechelt&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/6999072231/embed/310cc95eacba23cadd6e7b516255b681f8e049b5&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good ride to the Horseshoe bay ferry. Was nice to see friends on the way. Waiting at the ferry for two hours really cooled me down though 😢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the ferry, there’s those nice hills in Gibsons to contend with, ugh. The rest of the ride to Sechelt is nice and Porpoise Bay is a beautiful campground with a special bike section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1913.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night was cold, there was a wind warning and the wind was blowing across the campground. Because I wasn’t sure, I just grabbed most things and stuck them in the tent with me, leaving the bike to face the cold on it’s own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also put my food in a dry bag up a tree, because they’ve removed all bear proofing equipment from the cycling campground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-sechelt-to-comox&quot;&gt;Day 2: Sechelt to Comox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7004944540/embed/3458e9256de0f65fa111ca292a8dde7612e8e9c5&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; missing from Strava is the first 10km that I forgot to record from the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It rained overnight, but it wasn’t raining when I first woke up. It was just still windy. That meant I could pack up and get on my way easily enough for the misery that was about to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I passed Sechelt, it got really windy. Multiple times I was being blown sideways as the wind howled off the sea. Then it started to rain. Then I realised how much I hate this part of the highway. From Sechelt to Earls Cove it’s continual short steep climbs and descents. I was continually going from low gear to high gear and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Earls Cove I was cold, wet, battered and tired. I pulled into Earls Cove and had perfect timing straight onto the ferry. Ran upstairs and got a cup of tea to warm up. I was wiped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some nice man offered to drive me to Powell River, but I refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other side of the ferry to Powell River is better, there’s a big uphill, some flats and long downhills. It has nice wide shoulders and is easy to maintain a momentum. There was a two hour wait in a warm waiting room at Powell River for the next ferry as the wind and rain lashed down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at this point I made a decision to spend a night in Comox at a hotel and not turn right towards Campbell River and try camping. I realised I was not physically or mentally prepared for the original route, up to Cape Scott, and I went for plan B. I chose this route because I knew I could back out easily if I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-3-comox-to-parksville&quot;&gt;Day 3: Comox to Parksville&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7009588975/embed/a5d7e73a0f16fdb94184a4c64000b80528449490&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of north, I aimed south and made plans with a friend to stay on Salt Spring island on the way back. Cape Scott and northern Vancouver island will still be there for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a wonderful day, great riding in the sun on the quiet coastal road. The road is spectacular and has little traffic. Qualicum Beach and Parksville were lovely. I was aiming for &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikepacking.com/routes/englishman-river-overnighter/&quot;&gt;Englishman River falls to get in a bit of gravel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That trail was fun, but also got into some pretty narrow and steep singletrack that I wasn’t ready for on my heavily loaded bike, I had to walk a bunch of it. Then got to the top and found that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/englishman_rv/&quot;&gt;campground was closed&lt;/a&gt;. Normally that would be fine, but the water was turned off and it was a long walk to purify some. It was also an extremely mosquito infested campground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7010049726/embed/1e3b9a2da4660ec3bb670f52b7541087b481edb1&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I cycled back down to Parksville and stayed at the &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;gt;https://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/rathtrevor/&quot;&gt;absolutely amazing Rathtrevor Beach&lt;/a&gt; campsite. It was so much better and glad I got the ride up the trails and then stayed at an amazing campsite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/IMG_1932.jpeg&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point after 60km, 90km and 110km days… I was glad I was not heading to Cape Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-4-parksville-to-salt-spring&quot;&gt;Day 4: Parksville to Salt Spring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7015146276/embed/cbd203b7c1be7748c0e8a0a7a9b25fa34bcec25e&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another lovely day with sun, getting cloudier towards the end, but little rain. This route had its nice bits and it’s ugly parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Nanoose Bay you have to get on the highway for 5km+. Nanaimo center and south was terrible and there was more highway parts there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you get off the highway, again its a lovely ride through rural Vancouver island. Lovely little communities, few cars and long roads. The ferry from Crofton to Salt Spring is short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really starting to notice how tired my legs were getting at this point. It’s easy to look at 100km on a fast unladen road bike and think of doing that in 3-4 hours. It’s harder on a fully laden bike like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Salt Spring I was greeted by my friend and looked forward to some good chats, beer and food. First I had to cycle up to their house over the ridiculous Salt Spring hills (short and steep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-5-salt-spring-to-deep-cove&quot;&gt;Day 5: Salt Spring to Deep Cove&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/7019686713/embed/e71beedf61e735a8243e9ec58cb035d28871a110&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; missing from Strava is the first 11+km that I tried to record, but didn’t. Hey it was 5:00am in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that the best ferry leaves from Fulford Harbour at 6:20am. So I got up at 5am, put the lights on and road across Salt Spring in the dark. At the ferry I had breakfast and sat on the ferry for 2.5 hours as it worked its way via Pender, Maine and Galiano islands over to Tsawwassen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The route from Tsawwassen to Deep Cove is mostly miserable and riding along River Road is probably the most dangerous and insane thing to do. Just avoid this if you can, but Tsawwassen is extremely hard to get to by bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn’t rain, at least, but the cycling infrastructure in parts is just so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BC Ferries are awesome for cyclists. Cheap and you don’t need a reservation. They’ve usually got hot food, or some food. They are great, a real bonus if you are exploring this coast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 10 day trip around the North of Vancouver island is going to take some planning and some drops of supplies. I was carrying 5 days of food and couldn’t really carry much more. It’s also going to need better weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My legs and body would have failed me if I’d done that route. Turns out going from almost zero cycling to over 439km (this trip), along with 56km the day before plus a 10km running race… tired me out. I came home and did nothing for two days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would I recommend this route? I’d avoid doing Salt Spring to Tsawwassen if you can. I wish I’d cycled back to Nanaimo and taken the ferry to Horseshoe Bay. That part of the trip was so bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip had almost no gravel and was all paved. That’s ok, but I’d like to get more gravel time in if I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be back.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A bike</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-a-bike/"/>
<updated>2022-04-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/a-bike</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And of course I can’t go bike packing without a bike. I’ve got a Cervelo S3 disk, which is a fabulous and fast aero carbon fibre bike. But it’s designed for races and sprinting. It’s high geared, can’t take racks, isn’t designed for comfort and I worry when I leave it locked up anywhere. I needed something more practical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I headed over &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/&quot;&gt;Landyatchz&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent bike shop on Adanac. They are one of the ones I’d trust in the lower mainland to work on a bike and also build custom frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed was repeated visits over a couple of months to try out their bikes and see what else was available. I really couldn’t find much in other shops either, so two Landyatchz bikes became the favourite, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/shop/gravel/&quot;&gt;aluminium AB1&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://landyachtzbikes.com/bike/cb-mkii-blue/&quot;&gt;steel cb mkII&lt;a&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually wanted the latter, but to get one in my size would have meant waiting to August. Thanks supply chain. So I’ve got the aluminium AB1, in the newer colouring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;New gravel touring bike Saturday &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ES9mfCq7A6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/ES9mfCq7A6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andy McKay (@andymckay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andymckay/status/1512880146910375940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice gear range, but using SRAM Rival there’s only one gear on the front. Hydraulic disk brakes. Mount points absolutely everywhere. It’s a nice comfortable ride for long days in the saddle. Nice big fat tubeless tyres for off road bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building out the custom build was fun, but again the supply chain problems that are ongoing meant that the choices were rather limited unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways I’m really happy with the bike and some 600km later it’s done the job well, coping with gravel, road and everything I’ve thrown at it. The only two downsides so far is that I do wish the gear ratio went beyond 1:1. With all the bags on, it can be hard work getting up some of the bigger hills. Although I made it up everything that was paved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also would like tyres with less rolling resistance for the road. That’s an easy fix and based on my (perhaps faulty) assumption that I’d be doing more gravel than tarmac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, loading it up.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A tracker</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-06-tracker/"/>
<updated>2022-04-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/tracker</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m planning on travelling in lots of remote places and already do running and hiking in areas not covered by cell phone coverage. It’s pretty easy to get into those areas when you head off the beaten path in North Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided since I’m doing some adventuring alone, it might be time to invest in a tracker. There’s basically two brands out there that I found Garmin and Spot. I’m kinda allergic to Garmin, because the stuff I’ve bought from them has not worked out well in the past and would avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I went for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/spot-gen4&quot;&gt;Gen 4 Spot&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the cheapest and simplest and that’s all I want. It’s got 4 buttons, you press them and its sends a signal to your contacts. It regularly sends your location to its home base. It’s powered by 4 AAA batteries, so easy to keep up to charged on long trips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/SPOT/media/Products/SPOT-Gen4/SPOT-Gen4.png?ext=.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty simple and I’ve used it around Vancouver so far with no problems. I’m not sure if there’s going to be an update on this one, unless I get into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/service-plans#spot-gen4-plans&quot;&gt;Spot does have monthly plans&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to the extra costs of activation and a flex plan it quickly works out not much cheaper than an annual plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only downside is that if you do get into trouble you press the button and wait. There is no way to communicate with anyone. Just press it and hope help comes.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A sleeping bag</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-05-sleeping-bag/"/>
<updated>2022-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/sleeping-bag</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My sleeping bags are optimized for what I started doing in my old age, camping now and again in the summer when its hot. If I barely needed a sleeping bag? That’s the time to go camping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so with the crazy bike packing trips I had in mind. I need something better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By better it needed to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lightweight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pack down small&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Warm and cope with a couple of seasons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up with the Spark Ultralight Sleeping Bag from &lt;a href=&quot;https://seatosummit.com/products/spark-ultralight-sleeping-bag-series&quot;&gt;Sea to Summit&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2467/2501/products/Spark-Ultralight-Sleeping-Bag-Side-View.jpg?crop=center&amp;amp;height=1500&amp;amp;v=1626820119&amp;amp;width=1500&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its ultralight at 340g, made with ethically sourced down. It covers a couple of seasons of the year. It packs down really small and in my quick test seemed ultra warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve slept out three nights with the bag now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s light, it packs down well but I feel like I’m at the tolerance of warmth for the sleeping bag. It goes down to -2c and is listed as &lt;strong&gt;two seasons&lt;/strong&gt;. I’d hate to get a whole lot colder with this sleeping bag and I’ve had a couple of nights close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could also be the combination of the tent, which I’m not sure is ideal for windy weather.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Bike Packing in 2022</title>

<title>A tent</title>

<id>https://mckay.pub/a-tent</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The definition that is generally used for bike packing is that you are cycling off road on gravel and camping. Bike touring is used when you are staying in accomodation. I like to do both on the same trip and don’t care about names. But if I’m going to go camping, I need a tent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also plan to do some back packing and the options I currently have are either too big and heavy: a four person or two person tent from MEC, or suit a particular trip - my camping hammock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I got a new tent, requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Light&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Packs small&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can cope with most conditions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simple to put up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://tarptent.com&quot;&gt;tarptent&lt;/a&gt; and got a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tarptent.com/product/protrail-li/&quot;&gt;ProTrail Li&lt;/a&gt;. It’s super fast and easy to put up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tarptent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/protrail-li-side-view.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can either carry your own poles, or re-use your own trekking poles. For cycling I’ve got poles I can use, when I’m backpacking I’ll re-use my hiking poles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weight is a ridiculous 453g.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not designed for winter camping or snow, but that’s fine because that’s not something I intend to do anytime soon. It is a single wall tent, so we’ll see how it does with Pacific Northwest weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve slept out under the tent 3 nights now. I’ve found it draughty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably because I’m putting it up wrong, I’ve found a significant gap between the outer tent and the floor. I’ve had multiple occassions where I’ve felt the wind just gusting through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got to keep experimenting on this, perhaps I can improve things.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Using GitHub Actions to spot changes</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-02-20-has-something-changed/"/>
<updated>2022-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/has-something-changed</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One pattern that has become quite common at GitHub, for me, is using Actions to spot if something has changed. I use this to track changes in project boards, or changes in JSON payloads, changes in websites… basically anything out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic anatomy is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a workflow file that runs on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule&quot;&gt;schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a data file in your repository to store the data, for example in JSON or CSV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The workflow loads the data file from the previous time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loads the data from the source, probably with a bit of massaging to get it just right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compare the two.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send any changes to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slack-messenger&quot;&gt;slack channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the data file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commit the data file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then next time it runs, it just repeats the process. I wrote one recently to notify GitHub staff internally when a job gets posted to our external job board and its 85 lines of Python that we whipped up in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt; there is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-acceptable-use-policies#3-conduct-restrictions&quot;&gt;Acceptable Use&lt;/a&gt; policy for GitHub and if you do this alot you might hit that.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Tesla is trying to kill you</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-01-08-how-tesla-is-trying-to-kill-you/"/>
<updated>2022-01-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/how-tesla-is-trying-to-kill-you</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is one fundamental thing about driving a car: don’t hurt or kill anyone. There’s a bunch of other things, but that one is key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent update from Tesla has broken a bunch of things that means driving my Tesla is way my dangerous and I’m more likely to get into accident. That’s bad for me and you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;braking&quot;&gt;Braking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twice in the last week while driving my Tesla, I’ve had no regenerative braking. With no warning or indication that there’s a problem. Regenerative braking is key to braking in an electric car and occurs when you take your foot off the accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that sometimes you get in a car and 50% of your braking is gone. Sometimes it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Braking is fundamental to &lt;strong&gt;NOT KILLING PEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rain&quot;&gt;Rain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There used to be a button on the screen to turn on, off windscreen wipers. The button was in the same place and would bring up more options. The button was close to the driver and you got trained to find it if you drove in wet weather, like in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Depends on easy I guess. This button here was useful. Now its buried. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/X9xSW0N8st&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/X9xSW0N8st&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Andy McKay (@andymckay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andymckay/status/1478472132464033793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;January 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That button is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get to it by pressing the stalk, but that also triggers the wipers to wipe. There are multiple situtations where you might not want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t auto wipers in the Tesla work? No. They are shit. Just don’t even try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are driving in less then ideal conditions, stressed or dangerous conditions you need access to these things quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to see where you are going in the rain is fundamental to &lt;strong&gt;NOT KILLING PEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cold&quot;&gt;Cold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windscreens fog up because people breath, which is such an inconvenience. When your windscreen fogs up, you need to clear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There used to be a button for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The button is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get to it by swiping up on the air temperature section and then finding it in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you sometimes need to do this quickly and in less than ideal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to see where you are going in the cold is fundamental to &lt;strong&gt;NOT KILLING PEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;others&quot;&gt;Others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People complain about other things in the update, how it seems unfinished, access to seat heaters and so on is harder. I can cope with those, they are bad and Tesla should reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But losing access to brakes, harder access to wipers and defogging is critical to &lt;strong&gt;NOT KILLING PEOPLE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can really see an update by people who don’t seem to drive a car in anything other than perfect California weather.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Reporting a dangerous driver</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2021-12-04-reporting-a-driver/"/>
<updated>2021-12-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/reporting-a-driver</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A month or so ago I was a traffic light waiting to turn left. The car in front waited as well. Before the light turned green, it decided to do a left turn through a red light across multiple lanes of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This car was not turning left “late”. It made a &lt;strong&gt;deliberate and calculated decision to turn left on red light&lt;/strong&gt;. A few moments later the light would turn green allowing the opposing traffic to come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/turning-left.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit the button on my Tesla and got a full recording on video of the car doing this. When I got home I could see I got the license plate nice and clearly. So at this point I thought, let’s see what it’s like to report a driver… and here’s what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also&lt;/strong&gt; this driver has an “N” plate and is a new driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-where-to-report&quot;&gt;Finding where to report&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icbc.com/Pages/default.aspx&quot;&gt;ICBC&lt;/a&gt; isn’t interested. There is nothing on their website to report this. They are only interested when someone crashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This incident was on Boundary Rd which is the border between Vancouver and Burnaby. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://app.vancouver.ca/PoliceCitizenReporting_net/&quot;&gt;Vancouver police site&lt;/a&gt; is not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/vancouver-police.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out the juristiction for Boundary Rd. is actually the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=2114&amp;amp;languageId=1&amp;amp;contentId=64642&quot;&gt;Burnaby RCMP&lt;/a&gt;, so I went to their website. The Burnaby RCMP website let’s you report something online, yes there’s an option for “Someone was driving poorly”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if you have “video surveillance” you can’t report it online. That makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/burnaby-rcmp-nope.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have to phone them. I phoned their non-emergency line and waited over an hour and half. Gave the details and was told I’d be called back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-evidence-to-the-police&quot;&gt;Getting evidence to the police&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An officer phoned me back and said they’d need to see the video and I had to “drop it off”. Alright, if that’s what you want me to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I copy the video to a cheap old USB stick, because that’s the best idea I’ve got and have to drive over to Burnaby RCMP detachment (45 min return drive). They take my USB stick and say that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;follow-up&quot;&gt;Follow up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One month later I’ve heard nothing from anyone. I phoned Burnaby RCMP and they say I have to contact the constable to get my USB stick back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The email from the Burnaby RCMP doesn’t work (perhaps I wrote it down wrong), but if I can figure this out then I’ll have to drive back to Burnaby and pick it up (another 45 min return drive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They won’t tell me if anything happened, if any penalties were assessed because of privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cost me a USB stick and at least three hours. If I’m able to get my USB stick back, it will be closer to four hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fastest and easiest way to get satisfaction is to just post the video on social media&lt;/strong&gt;. Next time I’ll just do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a just huge pile of dis-incentives in this system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;it’s hard to find where to report a driver&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the institutions make it hard to report it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they make you go out of your way in terms of time and money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there’s no feedback so you don’t know what qualifies for reporting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you don’t know if you did any good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;strong&gt;no incentive to report a dangerous driver&lt;/strong&gt;. In fact, there are &lt;strong&gt;only dis-incentives to report dangerous drivers&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s pointless, costs you time and money, and you have no idea if anything happens as result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-we-could-improve&quot;&gt;What we could improve&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more cars have dashcams and more people have cars and cameras. We have more opportunity to make our roads safer than ever before, but we don’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some suggestions…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;make-it-easy-to-report&quot;&gt;Make it easy to report&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only place that seemed to care about reporting this was the Burnaby RCMP. The Vancouver police and ICBC didn’t allow anything on their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be easy to do on a website, answer a few questions, and then upload a video. It should take 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having to “drop off a video” these days is ridiculous. Videos can be uploaded to social media or another number of places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;provide-feedback&quot;&gt;Provide feedback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two crucial pieces of feedback that people need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One:&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing that drivers are being held accountable and people reporting them helps. This makes people report dangerous driving. Reports can be aggregate to avoid identifying individual drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two:&lt;/strong&gt; Feedback such as “that’s not dangerous driving and an offence” and “your video was inadmissable because of x” would help people figure out when to actually submit videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-someone-care&quot;&gt;Have someone care&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICBC is “a provincial crown corporation providing​ auto insurance, driver licensing, vehicle registration, road safety, and other products and services” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/company-info/Pages/Default.aspx&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it wants to take part in &lt;strong&gt;road safety&lt;/strong&gt; do you think it should care or help with this? It could collate and help forward information onto the appropriate law enforcement agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went into this knowing that likely nothing would happen. But I was dispirited how hard it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also made me realize how even more ridiculous the “license and register cyclists” argument is. We can’t even hold drivers of 2 ton machines that kill people and the planet responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cycling moments of terror</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2021-10-04-moments-of-terror/"/>
<updated>2021-10-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/moments-of-terror</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We know that British Columbia, by way of the Motor Vehicle Act, is not a province that supports cycling. Generally cycling here is one that involves moments of terror and then real terror depending upon the lack of infrastructure you face cycling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;britannia-beach&quot;&gt;Britannia Beach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cycle the sea to sky you will &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@49.636184,-123.2112272,3a,75y,40.89h,73.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0EcERbAEh5IO4b8YiZ47uQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192&quot;&gt;find this on the road out of Britannia Beach&lt;/a&gt;. That’s where the shoulder for cycling goes instantly with &lt;strong&gt;no signs&lt;/strong&gt; or warning down to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/britannia-beach.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cyclists are forced straight out into traffic. There’s no signs, no warning to cyclists or drivers. It’s on a right hand bend, so you are forced to cycle around the bend in the lane, where cars are doing 90 km/h. That means cars can’t actually see you as they go around the bend. Sheer terror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;porteau-cove&quot;&gt;Porteau Cove&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Porteau Cove there are lots of signs and warning to both cyclists and drivers this is happening. Its a less sharp right hand bend and I normally hit this at 40km/h+ on a bike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/porteau-cove.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does “Share the road” mean? Well because BC has no passing distance, I was cycling through this section at 40km/h a feet or two into the lane when a bus decided to pass me at 80km/h+. &lt;strong&gt;I was able to reach out my left arm and hit the bus&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s how close it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seymour-parkway&quot;&gt;Seymour Parkway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about the Seymour Parkway. There’s a bike lane, great. Highlighted with red arrow (and yes that’s a truck crossing it). Before that there’s no bike lane because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there’s a right turn lane for cars&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a lump of concrete with some signs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a bus stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/seymour-parkway-1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;before that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/seymour-parkway-2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a designated ICBC bike route, that ICBC wants to ride to avoid anatagonising drivers (yes, it’s all cyclists fault)… and again you have to swerve out into the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many moments of terror cycling because cycling infrastructure when it does occur is on a block by block basis and done with the minimal amount of cost and inconvenience to drivers.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Cycling to Deep Cove</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2021-06-06-cycling-to-deep-cove/"/>
<updated>2021-06-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/cycling-to-deep-cove</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week ICBC tweeted this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you’re out cycling this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoByBikeBC?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#GoByBikeBC&lt;/a&gt; week, please use designated bike routes whenever possible – they’re safer &amp;amp; reduce conflicts with vehicle traffic. Check your municipality’s website for designated bike routes or go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TransLink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@TransLink&lt;/a&gt; for Metro Vancouver cycling maps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tZt9wA5JXy&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/tZt9wA5JXy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; ICBC (@icbc) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/icbc/status/1400873754608209926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tweet is problematic for so many reasons and continues ICBC unhelpful approach,  victim blaming cyclist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this week the District of North Vancouver tweeted out that they are adding a bike valet to Deep Cove:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Construction is underway in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeepCove?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#DeepCove&lt;/a&gt;, so this weekend, take advantage of the free bike valet in Panorama Park and leave your car at home. The bike valet operates from 10am- 5pm on Saturdays, Sundays, and statutory holidays. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bihHZG0rlw&quot;&gt;https://t.co/bihHZG0rlw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/zNylpVbcWh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/zNylpVbcWh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; District of North Vancouver (@NVanDistrict) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NVanDistrict/status/1400861567168745472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what they won’t do, is make cycling to Deep Cove any safer. This continues a clear lack of co-ordination and planning with a patchwork of cycling improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume you coming to Deep Cove from somewhere around Ironworkers Memorial Bridge. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.translink.ca/-/media/translink/documents/rider-guide/cycling/local-area-maps/pack_tl-cyclemaps_northshore.pdf&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; for “designated cycling routes” is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.translink.ca/rider-guide/cycling-in-metro-vancouver#metro-vancouver-cycling-maps&quot;&gt;TransLink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two routes: Mount Seymour Parkway and Dollarton Highway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/designated-bike-routes.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Seymour Parkway&lt;/strong&gt; has two lanes of traffic each way travelling at 60km. There are areas with parked cars (dooring zone) and painted to seperate you from traffic. Until you get to Mt Seymour Road and then it ends, there is no more “designated cycling routes”. Most cyclists given the choice avoid this road because it’s dangerous and scary to be that close to vehicles moving that fast. It also has big hills at the start and end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollarton Highway&lt;/strong&gt; varies between two lanes and one lane of traffic travelling at 50km or 40km. There is one section of the highway that is not even designated as a cycling route. As a “designated cycling route” there is no continuous paint line, instead there are drawings of bicycles on the road and many “share the road” signs. Most cyclists chose this because it’s less hilly and scary than Mount Seymour Parkway. There are large parts of this route with parked cars (dooring zone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember&lt;/strong&gt; there is no safe designated passing distance in the Motor Vehicle Act, so it’s up to car drivers to decide their passing distance. If you ride a bike a lot, you’ll know what this means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, both those routes are designated as &lt;strong&gt;Comfortable for Few&lt;/strong&gt; by Translink, because there is no seperation from the traffic. Check out this graphic for that means according to TransLinks own website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/comfortable-for-few.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouraging people to cycle to Deep Cove by providing a bike valet is a commendable achievement. But &lt;strong&gt;without safe cycling infrastructure to get you to the bike valet&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s only going to result injury, accidents and worse. Translink website shows that’s it &lt;strong&gt;not possible to get all the way there on a designated bike route&lt;/strong&gt; and if you do, &lt;strong&gt;it’s only “comfortable for few”&lt;/strong&gt;. So what are we meant to do ICBC and the District of North Van?&lt;/p&gt;

<updated>2019-09-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A bit ago was my fifth Gran Frondo, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2018-09-09-fourth-fondo/&quot;&gt;the last&lt;/a&gt; was in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I dropped 25 minutes off my time and that made me really happy. This year my goal was 4 hours. This was just an aribtrary number, but it was also based on an attempt to qualify for the 2020 version of this race which is a UCI World Cup Event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to May I was almost continually running with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2344462557/overview&quot;&gt;BMO Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt; in May which I did in 2h 08m. In March, April and May I was running up to average of 40km a week.  I guess I was kind excited by that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;2:08:42 for my first half marathon - woot! Next year the full deal. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uwBDROsGSD&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uwBDROsGSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Destroy all cars (@andymckay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andymckay/status/1125131691234811904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;May 5, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I focused a lot on running this year, my riding patterns changed a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2017 (up to Fondo)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2018 (up to Fondo)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2019 (up to Fondo)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;243h&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;232h 16m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;165h 51m&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Distance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,050km&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5,279km&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3,889km&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Rides&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;198&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;136&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in 2019, I spent less time on the bike. In fact I haven’t spent this little time on a bike since &lt;strong&gt;2015&lt;/strong&gt;, which was my first year. After May I ran less frequently, but carried on running, varying between 0 (on bad weeks) to 30km (on good weeks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2018-05-27-mt-seymour/&quot;&gt;Mount Seymour&lt;/a&gt; at least 9 times (most yet) and broke my own personal record 4 times. I managed quite a few 100km plus rides: including the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2532536358&quot;&gt;160km Penticton Gran Fondo&lt;/a&gt; race, the challenge route of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2648420747&quot;&gt;Ride to Conquer Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a ride up to Whistler, and a couple of trips to Golden Ears park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this year I got a little more organised with my training. This is taped to my bedroom wall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mckay.pub/files/ED57AcSVUAEa5VC.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I rode with Steed group 2 a few times, that’s the second fastest group and sometimes they go at a hell of a pace. Last year I stepped up from group 4 to group 3. Next year I aim to have group 2 as my default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the race came and as usual I spent a few days before hand excited and not sleeping too well. Yet again I hadn’t lost enough weight and I really doubted if the 4 hour figure was reasonable. Just thinking through what I did last year to get to 4:19 seemed daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I started in the 4 to 4.5 corral which is essential to getting in with a good group. The first 30km was marred by several large and nasty looking crashes. I focused on going fast up to Squamish but needed to save something for later. As I passed my marker in Squamish I thought I was behind but honestly I didn’t feel like I’d pushed myself too hard and felt fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to me, I’d set personal records all the way and crushed it. My average was over 32km/h an hour at that point. To get close to 4 hours, my goal was to not let it drop below 30km/h. This year I couldn’t find good draughts in Squamish, the people were going too slow so I kept pulling out… and as a result pulled an awful lot of people through Squamish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I piled up the hills and again failed to find good draughts, despite thinking strategically and doing my best to line them up in the right places. About 25-30km out from Whistler I bonked again and realised I hadn’t been eating right. About 15km I was struggling hard and failing to keep up. My average km kept dropping and dropping. I was just pissed off and couldn’t understand why I couldn’t go faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2688389229&quot;&gt;I ended up crossing at 4h 16m&lt;/a&gt;. That’s 3 minutes faster - I was happy and sort of pissed off that I wasn’t faster. It’s my fastest ever time, I’ve been faster every year so I’ll take that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe height=&quot;405&quot; width=&quot;590&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.strava.com/activities/2688389229/embed/a40d29d1cc807aa0cb7d36fb4cb6830e9eca7f4c&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually I guess I was pretty happy with it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Fuck yeah! Fastest time yet 4:16 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DSdOEe33NG&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DSdOEe33NG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Destroy all cars (@andymckay) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/andymckay/status/1170415223066386432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 7, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not qualify for the World Cup race for next year, but I’ve signed up again to do the normal race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve signed up again and I’m going to crush 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
