<title>Service catalog - Using Actions</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-05-18-using-actions/"/>
<updated>2023-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/using-actions</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clearwind-ca/service-catalog&quot;&gt;service catalog&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2023-05-15-service-catalog/&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;) we want to be able to measure the “quality or readiness” of a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality or readiness of a service tends to be different from code quality, although they might be overlap. Ideas of readiness could include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the team specify a place for bugs or feedback?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the team specify an on-call rotation?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the team keeping on top of security issues?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the service meeting legal obligations or compliance?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the service vulnerable to urgent security problems?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does the team have appropriate metrics and dashboard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions and more are defined by the organization and different for every organization. Trying to code all those situations and questions is not within the service catalog’s goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to find a way to allow customers to be able to create and code health checks, while avoiding running arbitrary code in the service catalog &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. For this, GitHub Actions came to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s take an example, scanning all our services to ensure no one is vulnerable to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228&quot;&gt;Log4J vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the service catalog we create a health check for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Log4J&lt;/code&gt;. The service catalog will send a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch&quot;&gt;repository_dispatch&lt;/a&gt; on a schedule defined in the catalog for this check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In GitHub we’ll write an Action to grab the repository, scan it and send the result back to the catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how that Action would look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  log4j:
    env:
      # We&apos;ll need this to write back to the catalog.
      SERVICE_CATALOG_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SERVICE_CATALOG_TOKEN }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        # Grab the repository for the service that the catalog has sent to us.
        repository: ${{ github.event.client_payload.repository }}
    - run: |
        # Grab a log4jscanner.
        wget https://github.com/google/log4jscanner/releases/download/v0.5.0/log4jscanner-v0.5.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
        tar -zxf log4jscanner-v0.5.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
        cd log4jscanner
        ./log4jscanner $GITHUB_WORKSPACE &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/log4j.results
        
        # Write some annotations in the Action log and a JSON file
        # ready to send back to the catalog.
        if test -s &quot;/tmp/log4j.results&quot;; then
          contents=$(cat /tmp/log4j.results)
          echo &quot;::error::Vulnerable files found&quot;
          printf &apos;{&quot;result&quot;: &quot;fail&quot;, &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Vulnerable file(s) found: `%s`&quot;}&apos; $contents &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/service-catalog-result.json
        else
          echo &quot;::notice::All good, no vulnerable files found&quot;
          printf &apos;{&quot;result&quot;: &quot;pass&quot;}&apos; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/service-catalog-result.json
        fi
        echo `cat /tmp/service-catalog-result.json`

    # Send the result back
    - uses: clearwind-ca/send-result@main

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this code is running the log4j scanner and finding the vulnerable files. At the end there’s a simple Action &lt;a href=&quot;github.com/clearwind-ca/send-result&quot;&gt;clearwind-ca/send-result&lt;/a&gt; that sends the results to the catalog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a little chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
  ┌────────────────┐
  │ Service        │
  │                ◄──────────┐
  └────────────────┘          │
                              │
  ┌────────────────┐   ┌──────┴─────────┐            ┌───────────────────┐
  │ Health check   │   │ Health check   │ Dispatch   │ GitHub Action     │
  │                ◄───┤ Result         ├────────────►                   │
  └────────────────┘   └──────▲─────────┘            └──────┬────────────┘
                              │                             │
                              └─────────────────────────────┘
                                    Pass, fail response
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great parts about this approach are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grabbing and running arbitrary code is now sandboxed with GitHub Actions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The code and information about the code is on GitHub anyway (issue, repositories etc) so doing the work on GitHub makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GitHub Actions have great secret management, so you can store secrets for other services. That allows you to query other services like Slack, Pager Duty and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/marketplace?category=&amp;amp;query=&amp;amp;type=actions&amp;amp;verification=&quot;&gt;re-usable Actions within the GitHub Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; that we can use to do these checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Actions this way gives customers the chance to build these checks quickly and simply in Actions. Separation of concerns, allows us to focus on building the best thing in the catalog. And finally, don’t want to use Actions? That’s cool, there’s an API for the catalog that let’s you go down a different path if you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We could also do this by allowing custom code to be run in the catalog, however this has its own share of problems. Access to repositories, secret management, resource utilization, ease of upgrades and so on. Better to use an external service. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<title>Service catalog</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-05-15-service-catalog/"/>
<updated>2023-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/service-catalog</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I joined the on-call rotation at GitHub as we &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions&quot;&gt;launched GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;, being on-call was something that was pretty new to me. I learnt a lot and had some amazing experienced colleagues who taught me a lot and there’s still so much to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point GitHub had over 500 developers working &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on the site and all the parts, spread out across the globe. It also interacted with teams at other companies, such as Microsoft and the Azure teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigating and understanding your services, teams and dashboards in an organization is hard, it was at GitHub. Repeatedly I’ve spoken to organizations building tooling to solve this internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the problems you might have in your engineering organization 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;navigating-your-engineering-services&quot;&gt;Navigating your engineering services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the size, speed and scale of your organization grows just navigating the teams grows harder. New people who join the company can struggle to find who does what and what’s important. Veterans struggle to keep up with changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do those teams do? Who’s on the teams? Where do they hang out and communicate? What dashboards do they have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your answer is a document somewhere, a wiki, or so-on. The moment those documents are finished they are out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;quality-of-your-services&quot;&gt;Quality of your services&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’ve got a series of services that make up your product. Those will be spread out across the organisation with different ideas and leaders. Spreading ideas and information out across those services and teams is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools like Datadog, Splunk etc, are available to crunch all the run time information and provide you with good information about how users are using your service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are other metrics and measurements within an organisation that you need to make sure are kept up to date. How many security issues are there on the service? Are they being dealt with quickly? Are legal requirements satisified? Is the team within compliance? Has the team got on-call rotation setup?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a large organization you want to ensure that teams are meeting their goals before incidents happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-we-fix-a-problem&quot;&gt;How do we fix a problem?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time when an incident happened at GitHub we’d go through a progression that looked like this, in roughly this order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What just got deployed?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What got migrated or transitioned?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What just got turned on or off?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What external services we depend on are having problems?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are users doing to the site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an incident you need concise and clear information as soon as you can to reduce your time to mitigation. Cognitive overload and lack of clarity in an incident slows everything down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even just knowing the key deployments and releases over the last hour and then the correct teams to contact - reduces the time to mitigate incidents the majority of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;service-catalog-release&quot;&gt;Service catalog release&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last while I’ve been building a tool to do these things. The service catalog is tightly integrated into GitHub and GitHub Actions. Best of all, it’s free, open source and available for anyone to use straightaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check it out here 👉 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clearwind-ca/service-catalog&quot;&gt;https://github.com/clearwind-ca/service-catalog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/catalog-services-may-15.png&quot; width=&quot;500px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watch this space for some more articles about it and if you are interested in using this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://clearwind.ca/&quot;&gt;drop me a line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is an estimate, I don’t have the numbers and can’t remember the exact number 🤷‍♂ &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Trespassing in the US</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-04-20-wild-camping-in-us/"/>
<updated>2023-04-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/wild-camping-in-us</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been doing more back and bike packing in the last year, often solo. Get all your gear, point in a direction and go for days and days. Unfortunately when you do this life isn’t always predictable, you aren’t 100% sure how far you’ll walk or cycle that day, if anything will go wrong, if weather will change and so on. So in a pinch you might need to camp somewhere remote. Or perhaps you get lost and end up in private property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I was in Maui with my camping gear and had a wonderful time. You can camp on the beach legally in Hawaii, I looked at internet forums about “wild camping”, where you just put your tent down out of the way. In other parts of the world, this is wild camping. But when I rode past those areas it looked very, very sketchy. Everywhere else had big “private property” signs all over the place. You don’t realise until you go to the rest of the world, how much of the US is private property and how nerve wracking it feels to go places where you aren’t sure if something is private property or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;files/private-property.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, UK, Scandinavia, France, Italy, Austria etc, where I’ve done travels this has never worried me anywhere near as much. Ever. The UK is special because, yes a lot of land is private, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/katie-mingles-right-to-roam/&quot;&gt;right to roam&lt;/a&gt; gives you the chance to hike on that land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a pinch when I’ve ended up in the wrong place in a UK, someone has come and spoken to me nicely. I’ve done it Canada and people were helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the US strongly enforces trespassing laws… and there are so many guns. It’s just terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2005 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65282084&quot;&gt;stand your ground&lt;/a&gt; laws were introduced which are in effect in 28 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/law-and-life/is-it-ever-legal-to-shoot-trespassers/&quot;&gt;shooting at a trespasser is always a legal gamble&lt;/a&gt;”. A gamble, what the fuck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week there’s been a series of terrible shootings in the US that reminded me of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Accused of shooting a 6-year-old neighbor and her parents in North Carolina after a basketball rolled into his yard” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/20/us/neighbor-child-shooting-basketball-singletary/index.html&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Black teen shot at doorstep after ringing wrong doorbell” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65299127&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Two Texas cheerleaders shot after one gets into wrong car” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65330696&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Woman shot dead in New York state after friend pulled into wrong driveway” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65307556&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Why are Americans being shot for knocking on the wrong door?” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/19/why-are-americans-being-shot-for-knocking-on-the-wrong-door&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these are backpackers, struggling out in the wilderness, but it just doesn’t seem worth it. It’s stressful enough holidaying in the US knowing the number of gun deaths, possible bankruptcy due to medical problems, and the oversized trucks means I’m more likely to be killed on my bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawaii was nice and I would go back, but I’m unlikely to be going anywhere else by bike or foot in the US for while. Instead, there are so many other beautiful parts of the world to go.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What I'm up to</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-04-17-what-im-up-to/"/>
<updated>2023-04-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/what-im-up-to</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following up on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/2023-02-03-whats-next/&quot;&gt;what’s next&lt;/a&gt; I wanted to post a little about what I have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;actions-analyser&quot;&gt;Actions Analyser&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://analyser.clearwind.ca/&quot;&gt;hosted way to dive into your Actions billing reports&lt;/a&gt; and find out some important infomation like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;which repository in my organisation is consuming the most minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;which workflow within a repository is consuming the most minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;whats the change month over month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;variability in billings of workflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s completely free, you should check it out if you get an Actions bill and aren’t sure where the money is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;service-catalog&quot;&gt;Service Catalog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/clearwind-ca/service-catalog&quot;&gt;open source project&lt;/a&gt; to provide a way to track teams, applications and tools across an organisation. A similar tool was used a lot at GitHub and was being built at Vercel when I was there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combined with things like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andymckay/service-status-cli&quot;&gt;service status cli&lt;/a&gt;, my goal is to provide tooling to make services more robust and transparent when they go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots to do here before we can hit anything like an initial release, but it’s a fun project so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contracting&quot;&gt;Contracting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten back into &lt;a href=&quot;https://clearwind.ca&quot;&gt;contracting&lt;/a&gt; with my first project for an awesome local client in a very long time. It’s converting Excel spreadsheets for some business needs and doing it all in the browser. I’ll write up a blog post on that soon, but doing it client side in the browser has been such a win for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m open to more contracting or consulting opportunities, so if you know of any, please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:andy@mckay.pub&quot;&gt;let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beyond-cars&quot;&gt;Beyond cars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://beyondcars.ca/&quot;&gt;Beyond cars is a blog to advocate for cycling&lt;/a&gt;, mostly focused on BC. But hopefully relevant everywhere. This has been fun, there’s so much to write on the subject and my list of things to write about is bigger than I can keep up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overall&quot;&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months into this new phase of life, I’m enjoying things but realise that a lot of things have changed since I last did this. Back then I was heavily involved in Plone, Django and Python communities. The result was I received lots of contracts, opportunities and connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment I feel quite disconnected from those communities and hence oppportunities. This is something I’m going to have to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With zero curling rinks, Burnaby is a standout, however with curling rinks in Vancouver, New Westminster, Coquitlam and Port Moody, it has curling rinks in every adjoining area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a combined population of 190,410 for West Vancouver, District of North Vancouver and the City of North Vancouver, there are 0 curling rinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of this data is from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.curling.ca/about-curling/getting-started-in-curling/find-a-curling-centre/&quot;&gt;Curling Canada website&lt;/a&gt; which has several inaccuracies, unfortunately 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glanfordcurling.com/&quot;&gt;Glanford Curling Club&lt;/a&gt; is in Ontario, not Coquitlam. Sorry Curling Canada, you got that one wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://deltathistle.ca/&quot;&gt;Delta Thistle Curling Club&lt;/a&gt; is not listed on the Curling Canada site.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nswc.ca/curling.html&quot;&gt;North Shore Winter Club&lt;/a&gt; does not have curling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hollyburn.org/nor&quot;&gt;Hollyburn Country Club&lt;/a&gt; does not have curling.&lt;/li&gt;

<title>Everyone has already done it</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-22-happened-before/"/>
<updated>2023-02-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/happened-before</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In my new phase of work, I’m not trying to build a startup. I’m trying to do fun things that can solve problems, I get to learn new things and hopefully along the way be of value to some people. In the last few days I’ve ditched a couple of ideas (will blog about why in a bit). As I go through ideas, I’m reminded of one simple rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has already done everything”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to build a cool product? Someone has already done it. Somewhere, sometime, maybe even now, maybe many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. In fact, at its most simple level its validation that the thing you are planning to build has a market and has users. It means that the market exists. Perhaps they got &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firstmover.asp&quot;&gt;first mover advantage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t mean you can’t do it: faster, cheaper, or whatever you need to make it happen. Don’t be intimidated by others in your space, research what they’ve done and then go do it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before GitHub there was Sourceforge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Google there was Altavista.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Altavista there was Yahoo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and before before ChatGPT there was Google (just a bit of snark there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or as Battlestar Galactica put it “All of this has happened before and will happen again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href=&quot;https://consumerist.com/2007/12/29/want-a-thriving-coffee-shop-open-next-to-a-starbucks/&quot;&gt;Want a Thriving Coffee Shop? Open Next to A Starbucks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No marathons this year</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-15-no-marathon/"/>
<updated>2023-02-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/no-marathon</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The last 3 years my goal has to be do marathons and also long 160km+ bike races. But I’ve noticed this has produced a pattern in my behaviour that I’d like to break. The goal marathon for me has been the Vancouver BMO Marathon in May and we start training in January. So my years goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;January: I’m unfit and I’ve eaten too much, time to get into shape and train.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;February: Ugh, the worst time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;March: I’m doing 20km training runs and feeling good.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;April: I’m doing 30km training runs and feeling great. I’m not cycling enough and the cycling clubs have started.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May: Marathon. Marathons hurt, why am I doing this? I hate it. I’m falling behind on cycling. My legs hurt.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June: &lt;strong&gt;I hate running, I’m never running again.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m behind on cycling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;July: &lt;strong&gt;I hate running, I’m never running again.&lt;/strong&gt; I can’t catch up with the cyclists. I’m off my diet and gaining weight.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;August: Wow the mountains are amazing I’m going hiking. Forget running and cycling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;September: Big bike races. I hate cycling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;October, November, December: I’ve failed at cyling and running and I’m in a funk. Only 3 months till the cycle starts again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I peak at the marathon, it ruins my legs and I stop running. The running bites into my cycling and I fail at that. The thing is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve not gotten to the point where marathons aren’t destroying me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Running and cycling both take up lots of time to train a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My motivation drops off a cliff after the marathon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I actually enjoy the marathon training, 20-30km distances feel good and I can feel the improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see my fitness change here 👇&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/fitness-2023.png&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those circles are the BMO Marathon and the Whistler Fondo respectively. You can see the build up before hand, the inconsistency inbetween and then the drop at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I’m going to try to be more balanced and see if I can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just do half marathons, but increase my time regularly instead of aiming for longer distances.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be more balanced, with cycling, running, weights and hiking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve and maintain a base level of fitness instead of feeling like I have to climb out of a hole every winter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And maybe a triathlon.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Django - still awesome</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-09-django-still-awesome/"/>
<updated>2023-02-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/django-still-awesome</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I first started using Django in 2008. That’s forever ago in internet terms, as a I left Zope and Plone for something better. Later on I got a job at Mozilla doing Django full time, but then became a Manager and then moved on. I haven’t written Django for anything more than quick side projects for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in the last couple of weeks I’ve stood up a couple of projects on Django. Honestly its been an experience in learning and remembering how this stuff works. It’s been a lot of fun. I’ve stood up two Django sites since then and it’s as I remember, just better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of making exciting things with boring technology and after all this time Django is one of those “boring” technologies that just works really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still a fan and that’s a credit to the people and the community that have kept Django going. Well done to all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still prefer to Rails 😀&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Actions, IPv6 and Fly.io</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-08-actions-ipv6/"/>
<updated>2023-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/actions-ipv6</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stood up a service on fly.io as a subdomain of an existing site. You can do this by adding a CNAME record to your DNS pointing to the fly.io instance. In this case &lt;a href=&quot;https://clearwind.ca&quot;&gt;clearwind.ca&lt;/a&gt; is managed on Google Domains and currently points to GitHub pages site. Then &lt;a href=&quot;https://notifications.clearwind.ca&quot;&gt;notifications.clearwind.ca&lt;/a&gt; is a fly.io instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do this on the dashboard, you’ll get a page that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/flyio-ipv6.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added it all in, waited for DNS to update and it all worked. However, when I tried to hit using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; in GitHub Action, I kept hitting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Connecting to notifications.clearwind.ca (notifications.clearwind.ca)|2a09:8280:1::db06|:443... failed: Network is unreachable.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s correctly resolved the IPv6 domain, so I wasn’t quite sure what the problem was. I couldn’t spot anything in the Actions documentation. In the end it was simple as adding in the IPv4 address for the domain. That isn’t shown on the fly.io dashboard, but you can find it in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Application&lt;/code&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IP addresses&lt;/code&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case adding in an A name to that IP address fixed the issue and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; worked as expected. Why fly.io is doing this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.fly.io/t/announcement-shared-anycast-ipv4/9384&quot;&gt;covered here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>New blog - Beyond cars</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-07-new-blog/"/>
<updated>2023-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/new-blog</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This blog has been around for 16 years, which is just wierd. Most of the time I’ve focused on tech ramblings. But over that time things have changed significantly for me. These days I want to put in a lot of energy for arguing against cars, car dependency and advocating for other solutions in our cities. As such I’m going to move all that to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://beyondcars.ca&quot;&gt;new blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really excited by this, over the years I’ve built up a huge list of articles that I’d like to work on and dig more deeply into some important subjects with a Canadian and Vancouver angle on them. I want to do a lot of advocacy in this area and this is just one of the ways I’ll be doing it. As a result this blog will hopefully become just more focused on technical stuff, because I really need to get back into blogging about some of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways there’s a new blog here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://beyondcars.ca&quot;&gt;Beyond Cars&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://hachyderm.io/@beyondcars&quot;&gt;Mastodon account&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>What's next</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-03-whats-next/"/>
<updated>2023-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/whats-next</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As some of you may know, for the last few years I worked at GitHub as part of an amazing team building &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.github.com/en/actions&quot;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;. I got to work on stuff that really did change how people build software. I was there from the re-invention after it’s announcement (there were earlier days) until early 2022. I was immensely proud of Actions. When people ask what I’ve done in my career, the two biggest product achievements remain: moving Firefox over to WebExtensions and building GitHub Actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But last year it was time for a change. GitHub were kind enough to give me a extended holiday to think about things, hence all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mckay.pub/tags/trips/&quot;&gt;2022 trips&lt;/a&gt;. I came back and worked with the wonderful Dependabot team for a while, but alas it wasn’t to be and I voluntarily moved on to the next thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vercel&quot;&gt;Vercel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That next thing was &lt;a href=&quot;https://vercel.com/&quot;&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt; which I was excited about, moving to a smaller company focused on some things that I thought were interesting. However a few months later, it turns out that wasn’t the place for me and I chose to leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to get into the details of why Vercel didn’t work out for me, but suffice to say that the cultural fit was missing, along with a few other things. There’s some really good people at Vercel building some very good stuff and I wish them only the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;timing&quot;&gt;Timing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could timing be any worse? At the same time as I decide to leave Vercel so many other people around the technology world are also being laid off. It’s tough for so many people right now, but finding a full time job (that doesn’t suck) right now is hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone having to do that 💚 and if I can help at all, please drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times like this its important to remember that organisations and the jobs are temporary. The people, the relationships and the connections are what last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I’m not looking for another full time job at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-my-roots&quot;&gt;Back to my roots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before GitHub, there was Mozilla and before Mozilla there was open source work at a few different places. There was Plone (which is still going) and Django (still awesome) and Python (still my favourite language).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those days had young daughters, was just starting my career and learning so much that it was tough. I quickly had to take jobs to pay the bills, do consulting and the thought of going a month without income was really hard and stressful. I’m sure many of you can relate to this 😢&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these days thanks to places like Mozilla and GitHub (and Microsoft for buying GitHub) the situation is different. I’m more secure financially and that gives me the freedom to do what I want in a work situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so&quot;&gt;So…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see this as an amazing opportunity in life that I haven’t had before. So over the next while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Primarily: &lt;strong&gt;I’ll be focusing on missions I care about, the environment, cycling etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ll be aiming to build some projects and products.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consulting, advising and supporting where I can.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoiding on-call rotations, because they are the worst.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spending a lot of time working on my running, cycling and hiking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blogging a lot more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connecting more with people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, it’s all about the mission and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m not looking for work right now, unless it’s something super awesome or special or I get to work closely with someone amazing from my past 👋 If so, drop me a line.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>No we don't need a third bridge</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2023-01-30-third-bridge/"/>
<updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/third-bridge</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It seems odd that we’d have to say this, but we don’t need a third bridge to Vancouver in North Vancouver. Yet apparently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsnews.com/opinion/almost-two-thirds-of-north-shore-readers-say-a-new-bridge-is-needed-6423723&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; suggests that two thirds of readers say they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-the-easy-choice&quot;&gt;It’s the easy choice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s people in cars everywhere, we build roads, bridges and car parks and so on. When you see traffic congestion it’s simple to just want to build more infrastructure. Build more roads and bridges and the traffic will get better right? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember this is the community that has seen $250 million invested in the interchange at Mountain Highway and traffic has just gotten worse and worse since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easy choice is the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-would-it-actually-go&quot;&gt;Where would it actually go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/options.png&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-six-possible-routes-for-rapid-transit-across-burrard-inlet&quot;&gt;This article discusses some routes&lt;/a&gt; and breaks them down into bridges and tunnels. The tunnels are all around Stanley Park, because no-one wants to knock the tress down in the park. Well some people do, but let’s assumes that’s politically unpalatble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bridges are all around Second Narrows, because it’s a shorter and easier bridge to build with some houses and industrial land on either side. Industrial land is much easier to rezone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a tunnel! There have been so many tunnels proposed, but it’s really expensive and hard. Burrard Inlet gets to 66m deep. If you build a tunnel, you have to build the infrastructure to get to it, which brings to my next point…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-would-it-need-on-either-side&quot;&gt;What would it need on either side?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand around the Second Narrows? On the north side you hit the highway going north and the “cut” which is constrained to a couple of lanes each way. There isn’t really room to grow there. Highway 1 is 2 to 3 lanes across the North Shore, so widening that would require a vast re-allocation of land. On the south side you hit Cassiar tunnel which is going to be really hard and expensive to expand and then it goes on through the rest of Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expand around Lions Gate? At the south end you’ll just drop a pile of traffic into downtown, because downtown isn’t struggling with too many cars already. On the north side the traffic currently goes left, towards Park Royal or right towards Marine Drive. Neither of which can take more load, so those will need changing and possibly build more of a highway up to Highway 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the middle, near the Seabus? So how would the traffic get there? Would we have to turn Lonsdale into a highway to connect up Highway 1? Where on earth would a highway landing in East Vancouver go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you increase the bridge capacity, you have to increase the capacity around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-cheaper-than-transit&quot;&gt;It’s cheaper than transit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of the Skytrain is roughly $500 million per km for the Broadway Skytrain construction. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I’m no expert but that seems really expensive, but I’m not an expert on why it costs that much.  A suggested line across the North Shore and then to downtown at 20km could be roughly in the $10 billion price range. But it’s probably more expensive due to the bridge. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of the Massey Tunnel replacement is $4.15 billion, the suggested bridge replacement was $2.7 billion. &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not really worth trying to compare a 20km rapid transit line to a bridge that is 629m long, but let’s be clear: road infrastructure is expensive to build, expensive to maintain &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and involves zero user fees. Don’t be fooled that it’s cheap to build or maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-next&quot;&gt;What next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way out of this problem, for many reasons I haven’t covered, including climate change, accessibility, climate change, health, increasing density and so on is to increase our investments in alternative forms of transport. From active transport like cycling to public transit like buses and trains. No city has solved this by building more bridges. And it will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/files/portland.png&quot; width=&quot;300px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really want to live in a place like that (sorry Portland)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saddest part of the article “less than 18 per cent – indicated they’d need more information to have an informed opinion on the topic.”. It’s not just that people have this opinion, it’s that they don’t want to learn more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>North Vancouver District - 2022 Elections</title>
<link href="https://mckay.pub/2022-10-13-nvandistrict/"/>
<updated>2022-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
<id>https://mckay.pub/nvandistrict</id>
<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I will be voting on the weekend: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mrmathewbond/&quot;&gt;Matthew Bond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jordanback&quot;&gt;Jordan Back&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jimhanson_nv&quot;&gt;Jim Hanson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/globalpope&quot;&gt;Catherine Pope&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ellisonmallin&quot;&gt;Ellison Mallin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mobile.twitter.com/harrison4nv&quot;&gt;Harrison Johnston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because we need change in North Vancouver District and the existing council have repeatedly failed to produce this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In North Vancouver, there are two big intertwined issues, transportation and housing. The majority of residents living in North Vancouver work somewhere else, the majority of people working in the North Vancouver live somewhere else. That’s because house prices here are so high and everyone has to come into the district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These candidates seem to understand the problems that exist in the district and want to bring change and improvements. We can’t keep having single family homes across the district that no-one can afford to buy. We can’t keep increasing investment in cars and car infrastructure because it doesn’t solve anything, induced demand just keeps bringing more cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best time to invest in active forms of transport was years. The second best time to do it is now. Specifically candidates who said things like “I cycled to this meeting along the Seymour Parkway, and let me tell you its not pleasant” will get my vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who I listened to and won’t vote for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Little, Lisa Muri and Betty Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Betty Forbes is the person who got on council to ban pigeons, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/north-van-pigeons-betty-forbes-1.5964869&quot;&gt;because her neighbour has one&lt;/a&gt;. She thinks that cycling &lt;a href=&quot;https://bikehub.ca/municipal-elections/northvandistrict&quot;&gt;is well funded&lt;/a&gt; and suggested that building more parking lots and having bus shuttles will reduce traffic. Yep, more parking to have less cars. So pretty clueless on that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s Mike Little’s opinion on cyclists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;.&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NVanDistrict?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@NVanDistrict&lt;/a&gt; incumbent Mayor Mike Little: if cyclists really cared about safety, they’d look like motorcyclists, with their protective clothing. But our cyclists won’t even go one block out of their way! They want to be on the main drag. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just doesn’t get it. Vote accordingly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/B3zUZREgR5&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/B3zUZREgR5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Martyn Schmoll (@martynschmoll) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/martynschmoll/status/1580589310973480960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His opinion on traffic is that he’s working on a business plan for skytrain (sometime in the next ten years) and a replacement for the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge. So in twenty years Mike might bring some change to the District. Maybe, but in the meantime it’s all cyclists fault. I’ll go tell my daughter to go buy motorcycle gear and stay out of the way of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lisa Muri is confusing, because she’s extremely good at talking and confusing the issue. But when I’ve listened to her I found undertones of being obstructionist, unhelpful and blaming others. Lisa has been a councillor for 25+ years and plays politics well - if you don’t want anything to change in North Vancouver she’s your candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Teevan? Well a life long worker in finance at automative dealerships wants to build a 6 lane each way multi level replacement to the Ironworkers Memorial bridge. One more lane will fix it, bro.&lt;/p&gt;
