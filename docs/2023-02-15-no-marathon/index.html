<h2><a href="/2023-02-15-no-marathon/">No marathons this year</a></h2>
<hr class="florished">
<p>The last 3 years my goal has to be do marathons and also long 160km+ bike races. But Iâ€™ve noticed this has produced a pattern in my behaviour that Iâ€™d like to break. The goal marathon for me has been the Vancouver BMO Marathon in May and we start training in January. So my years goes like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>January: Iâ€™m unfit and Iâ€™ve eaten too much, time to get into shape and train.</li>
  <li>February: Ugh, the worst time.</li>
  <li>March: Iâ€™m doing 20km training runs and feeling good.</li>
  <li>April: Iâ€™m doing 30km training runs and feeling great. Iâ€™m not cycling enough and the cycling clubs have started.</li>
  <li>May: Marathon. Marathons hurt, why am I doing this? I hate it. Iâ€™m falling behind on cycling. My legs hurt.</li>
  <li>June: <strong>I hate running, Iâ€™m never running again.</strong> Iâ€™m behind on cycling.</li>
  <li>July: <strong>I hate running, Iâ€™m never running again.</strong> I canâ€™t catch up with the cyclists. Iâ€™m off my diet and gaining weight.</li>
  <li>August: Wow the mountains are amazing Iâ€™m going hiking. Forget running and cycling.</li>
  <li>September: Big bike races. I hate cycling.</li>
  <li>October, November, December: Iâ€™ve failed at cyling and running and Iâ€™m in a funk. Only 3 months till the cycle starts again.</li>
</ul>

<p>I peak at the marathon, it ruins my legs and I stop running. The running bites into my cycling and I fail at that. The thing is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Iâ€™ve not gotten to the point where marathons arenâ€™t destroying me.</li>
  <li>Running and cycling both take up lots of time to train a lot.</li>
  <li>My motivation drops off a cliff after the marathon.</li>
  <li>I actually enjoy the marathon training, 20-30km distances feel good and I can feel the improvement.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see my fitness change here ðŸ‘‡</p>

<p>Those circles are the BMO Marathon and the Whistler Fondo respectively. You can see the build up before hand, the inconsistency inbetween and then the drop at the end.</p>

<p>This year Iâ€™m going to try to be more balanced and see if I can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Just do half marathons, but increase my time regularly instead of aiming for longer distances.</li>
  <li>Be more balanced, with cycling, running, weights and hiking.</li>
  <li>Improve and maintain a base level of fitness instead of feeling like I have to climb out of a hole every winter.</li>
</ul>

<p>And maybe a triathlon.</p>
