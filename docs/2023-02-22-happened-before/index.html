<hr class="florished">
<p>In my new phase of work, I’m not trying to build a startup. I’m trying to do fun things that can solve problems, I get to learn new things and hopefully along the way be of value to some people. In the last few days I’ve ditched a couple of ideas (will blog about why in a bit). As I go through ideas, I’m reminded of one simple rule:</p>

<p>“Everyone has already done everything”</p>

<p>Want to build a cool product? Someone has already done it. Somewhere, sometime, maybe even now, maybe many people.</p>

<p>It doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it. In fact, at its most simple level its validation that the thing you are planning to build has a market and has users. It means that the market exists. Perhaps they got <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/firstmover.asp">first mover advantage</a>.</p>

<p>But this doesn’t mean you can’t do it: faster, cheaper, or whatever you need to make it happen. Don’t be intimidated by others in your space, research what they’ve done and then go do it better.</p>

<p>Before GitHub there was Sourceforge.</p>

<p>Before Google there was Altavista.</p>

<p>Before Altavista there was Yahoo!</p>

<p>…and before before ChatGPT there was Google (just a bit of snark there).</p>

<p>Or as Battlestar Galactica put it “All of this has happened before and will happen again.”</p>
