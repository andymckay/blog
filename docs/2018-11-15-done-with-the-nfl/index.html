<h2><a href="/2018-11-15-done-with-the-nfl/">So done with the NFL</a></h2>
<hr class="florished">
<p>I&#39;ve been an NFL for fan for a long time. It started before university when I rebelled against any sport that was vaguely popular at school (and seemed absolutely terrible). For no other reason than they did well at the time, I became a Washington Redskins fan (yes I&#39;m old).</p>

<p>I started a football team at university, I was involved in it. I even heard Chuck Noll speak once. If there was a Redskins game on TV, I would go up to the local pub in my jersey and watch the game.</p>

<p>Over the last few years I&#39;ve become pretty upset with what the NFL has become. Well the NFL has always been this way - but I didn&#39;t care. I enjoyed the game, the drama, the strategy, the rivalies, and I ignored or excused away all the problems for my own enjoyment.</p>

<p>Finally I realised that I couldn&#39;t keep doing this. The problems just kept increasing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Redskins is a terrible name for a team and is pretty much condemned as a racist. They need to change it, but they won&#39;t because the Redskins make lots of money for Daniel Synder (Redskins owner).</p></li>
<li><p>The treatment of players and the problems with concussions has been terrible. The NFL has swept it under the rug for so long. Yes they&#39;ve introduced changes, but tried to balance the fundamental problems that constant head contact is part of the game.</p></li>
<li><p>Cheerleaders.</p></li>
<li><p>Colin Kapernick.</p></li>
<li><p>The owners siding with Trump over their players.</p></li>
<li><p>The NFL is technically taxed as a charity so it isn&#39;t a good corporate citizen. </p></li>
<li><p>The league owners hold regularly hold cities and tax payers to ransom over stadiums.</p></li>
<li><p>So many adverts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Daniel Snyder is one such business person and I don&#39;t want to support him. I want to be proud of the thing I spend so much time following and I want to be a good example to my daughters. The only way I know how to do that is stop watching the NFL.</p>

<p>It&#39;s now over half way through the season, I haven&#39;t watched a game, I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going. I&#39;ve unsubscribed from all the football blogs, podcasts and tweets. They were showing the standings on the TV in a pub and it showed that the Redskins are doing quite well this year after years of being crap. But whatever, I don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Perhaps something will change to make me go back, but its not the game being boring, it&#39;s the sides that the NFL takes. Somethings got to change.</p>

<p><b>Footnote:</b> with the exception of the Green Bay Packers who are the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team. Have no cheerleaders, play in all kinds of weather and are just awesome. They haven&#39;t solved the problem about treating their players properly or being in a league with other terrible people though.</p>
