        <p class="my-3 ">
            <p>Last year I bought the <a href="/2024-09-06-another-tent.html">Big Agnes UL1 Tent</a> which was a replacement for my <a href="/2022-04-04-a-tent.html">Tarptent ProTrail</a>. I liked the Big Agnes tent so much, I sold my Tarptent and then bought another one. This time a 2 person tent to replace our aging 23+ year old MEC tent, which is heavy and in bad shape.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">🚨 Big Agnes is a US company 🤦‍♂, so Canadian 🇨🇦 buyers beware. I bought this in 2024, before the current administration.</div>

<p>The Tiger Wall UL2 Tent, like the UL1 Tent is a white "solution dyed" tent, which is meant to consume much less water during the production process. Like the UL1, it's light coming in at 776g when I weighed it on my scales at home, compared to 556g for the one man. That's light enough that I can use it for backpacking comfortably and took it to New Zealand and multiple trips within British Columbia.</p>
<p>Unlike the UL2 tent, it has doors and vestibule on either side of the tent, allowing occupants to get in and out easily, without disturbing others. The tent is a squish, you have to like the person you are in the tent with, there's enough room for my and the wife to lie flat on our backs, but not alot more.</p>
<p>It comes with pockets on the sides, the top above heads and above the feet. This is enough space to put all your light stuff, leaving the rest to the vestibule.</p>
<p>Like the UL1, it's semi-free standing, the frame stands on it's own at the front and sides, but the back requires at least two pegs. So far I've put up the tent on wooden pads and it's been just fine.</p>
<p>It's listed as three season tent and since I don't really camp in the winter, this is just fine for me.</p>
<p>I got this on sale and it's not listed on Big Agnes site anymore, but so far I'm very happy with all the Big Agnes tents I've bought. </p>
<p>Total weight as carried - fly and inner sheet, poles, pegs with bag for each: <code>1126g</code></p>
<p>If you are looking for a Canadian tent supplier, check out <a href="https://durstongear.com/">Durston</a>, I haven't used their tents yet, but starting to see them more on hikes.</p>
