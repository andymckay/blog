<hr class="florished">
<p>Jon Udell posts on <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/05/23.html#a1453">web presentations</a>, pointing to <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">S5</a> and<a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/"> HTML Slidy</a>. Both of these are excellent systems and I think the time has truly come to seperate the world from their PowerPoint dependencies.</p>

<blockquote>There's an option in HTML Slidy to make each slide's title the HTML doctitle, and of course I turned that on because I'm always looking for ways to make my stuff more coherent and useful in search results contexts. But to no avail.</blockquote>

<p>Good question, as I’m doing quite a bit of plotting and planning around presentations right now. The simplest solution is a <em>publish</em> process to publish pages individually.</p>

<p>In a slightly different arena, this problem has also cropped up at <a href="http://www.enfoldsystems.com">Enfold</a> recently where I’ve been addressing a complete Ajax front end for <a href="http://www.plone.org">Plone</a>. In this scenario Enfold Entransit writes out a complete set of xml to the filesystem, it screams Ajax to pull it together. But then how do bots index the site? No idea.</p>

<p>But then this does beg the question, how valuable to a search engine is a multi page view of a topic? Does that truly represent how the data should be presented? I would argue its not that important. For me the breaking down of a slide into multiple pages is an act of logical planning through my topic. Individually each slide taken out of context, is only partially useful in comparison to the whole.</p>

<p>Breaking down of the talk into slides is purely a representation of the time frame for the talk and the limit of only being able to fit one set of things onto a screen. The fact that all that content can be shown in one HTML page (as below) is to me good enough.</p>

<p>For the record a couple of interesting things. I’ve been using S5 for about 2 years and its great. I added S5 support to Plone then, mainly out of frustration dealing with Powerpoint and OpenOffice. It’s really nice to be able to write a presentation in any format Plone can handle: Structured text, Restructured text, HTML via Kupu or Epoz gui editors or just plain HTML. Then its output as a presentation, for example:</p>

<p>Plain page: <a href="http://www.enfoldsystems.com/About/Talks/overview">http://www.enfoldsystems.com/About/Talks/overview</a></p>

<p>S5 presentation: <a href="http://www.enfoldsystems.com/About/Talks/overview/s5_document">http://www.enfoldsystems.com/About/Talks/overview/s5_document
</a></p>

<p>Aas with many things, it was Jon Udell who started me down this path about 5 years ago by complaining to me about having to open one of my presentations in PowerPoint.</p>
