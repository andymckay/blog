<p>Every so often it crosses my mind - time to give up computers and do something else. Move on to something else. Maybe writing full time. Maybe canoe guide or instructor. Maybe take up woodworking seriously.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure why I keep thinking that another career would be any better or worse than this one. The grass is always greener, as they say. Perhaps it&#39;s the simple things. What are the problems at the moment?</p>
<ul>
<li>Although I&#39;ve done it for a long time now, working alone in a home office can be a pretty lonely experience - more human interaction and company maybe?</li>
<li>Sitting at a computer is not good for the health. I&#39;ve never been one of life&#39;s fittest and most active people, but I do love going outside. Struggling to make time to do that these days.</li>
<li>I seem to spend a lot of time in my RSS reader, reading about how other people are doing exciting things and starting things up. Perhaps I need to spend less time reading and just doing (even if it is a bit blind).</li>
<li>I seem to spend a lot of time thinking about how to get things better or make money from idea X or Y.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps in the end I&#39;m spending too much time thinking. Sitting at computer with all these information sources can be a curse. Whenever I start a project for myself or a client, I Google the details. As I go through the development process, I&#39;m continually looking for code, libraries and thinking of more efficient ways to complete the project. All well and good, but its a process that involves lots of thought. By design it&#39;s a process that involves lots of  thinking. Perhaps I need to do less of that some days.</p>
<p>If you were going to throw in the chips on an IT career, what would you do?</p>
