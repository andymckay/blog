<hr class="florished">
<p>I am getting very frustrated with the weather here! It’s supposed to be just like Vancouver weather - a few days of rain followed by a week or 2 of sunshine, then maybe a bit of rain again, and if we’re lucky a short heatwave and so on. But no, so far all we’ve had is rain, rain, rain!<br /><br /></p>

<p>Since the 1st of June we have had maybe 10 days that it has not rained at all, and never more than 2 in a row. I’ts just crazy!<br /><br /></p>

<p>The weather causes a huge problem with the laundry because even though it’s raining, it’s too warm to have the heating on. And since we don’t have a dryer, we have to hang our clothes on the radiators or on the line to dry. But it’s too wet to hang the clothes outside and too warm to dry them on the radiators.  So I find myself only washing the things we run out of, like underwear and nappies, and on the occasional sunny day I do a bit of catching up.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Right now I have about 8 loads worth of clothes piled up in and around the laundry baskets cause I can only wash as much as I can dry. If we had a few nice hot days, the clothes would dry much faster and I could get several loads done - at least enough to get rid of the piles around the baskets! But no, it’s going to rain again today. It’s not raining yet, though, so I’ve hung out the latest load in hopes that it will dry before the downpour that is imminent.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I suppose I should be thankful that we are not among those affected by the flooding that is happening for the second time this summer all over the country. Will we ever get our summer? I hope so, for the sake of the flood victims as well as my laundry!</p>
