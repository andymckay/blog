<hr class="florished">
<p>We went to the Butterfly House at the Ashton Memorial in Lancaster today. It was warm and somewhat cloudy, so we didn’t think about jackets when we left… It started raining as we got out of the car and was chucking it down by the time we’d made the trek through the park to the Butterfly House, so we were absolutely drenched!<br /><br /></p>

<p>Anyway, once we got there, the house was kept very hot and humid, so we warmed up even if we didn’t dry out.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The kids had a great time. Emily was fascinated by the turtles and fish that were in the little stream that ran around the edge of the house. Sams LOVED the butterflies! Each time one came close to her she’d point at it and follow it with her finger while cooing with delight. Too cute!<br /><br /></p>

<p>The rest of the place was a bit disappointing - some “mini beasts” (scorpions, snakes, frogs, etc), some birds (nothing too fancy or exciting), and some small mammals in outdoor enclosures (which had all gone into hiding because of the rain, so all we saw were 3 chipmunks). But we really enjoyed the butterflies, and that was what we really came to see, so that’s alright then.</p>
