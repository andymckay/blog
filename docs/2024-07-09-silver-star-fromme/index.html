<p>On the weekend I was in Silver Star resort, so did some hiking on Silver Star Mountain. These aren‚Äôt peaks on the North Shore, but it was nice to do something different. We hiked up over Silver Star, down into the provincial park and then back around the hill.</p>

<p>It was hot and the hike up was surrounded with lovely wildflowers. Going into the provincial park side wasn‚Äôt much to speak of, long trails with no people, no views, trees on every side, boggy and with bugs. The Black Prince cabin was neat though. Overall it was nice to get a lot of kms on new boots and it was pretty and sunny.</p>

<p>Given that Silver Star hiking trails are very few, since its mostly for mountain bikers, and then they charge you to hike - I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it as a hiker.</p>

<p>Today I did Fromme, which is a peak for the peak baggers list. We went down from the Gondola, then up pipeline pass and up to the top of the mountain. Then all the way down to Skyline road.</p>

<p>Overall I really liked Fromme, not too long and steep. A nice flat top to relax on and (mostly) a nice gentle downhill. Would recommend as a nice day hike for most people. It was also really cool to see good views of all the other mountains I‚Äôll be doing as well üòé</p>
