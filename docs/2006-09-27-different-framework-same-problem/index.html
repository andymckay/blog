<hr class="florished">
<p>One thing I&#39;ve enjoyed doing the last year is taking a bit of a step away from being blinkered solely on Plone and Zope and take a look around at other things out there. And no surprise -  all these fancy new frameworks out there don&#39;t actually solve some problems. The exact same problems and patterns exist out there. All too often in IRC channels or from managers I&#39;ve heard an answer like &quot;so if move away from Plone we&#39;ll fix this problem&quot;. Chances are you won&#39;t, chances are other framework&#39;s have the same problem.</p>

<p>Take for example the &quot;pulling large amount of data from a remote source&quot; situation. I&#39;ve seen this now in Plone, Zope, Ruby on Rails and heard about it Drupal. The problem is simple, you&#39;ve got a source that contains a large amount of records, such as a SQL server or and LDAP server. You write code to show the first 20 users and but the rest behind next links. Works with 10, 20, 200 users. Now throw 5 million in there and what happens. It falls over.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pattern that developers (like myself) need to learn and in LDAP&#39;s case its a limitation of the tool. OpenLDAP has recently started to support this kind of &quot;give me records 200-300 out of this possible 1,000 records&quot; but no fiddling on the framework is going to change that. I was in a Drupal birds of a feather and I remember hearing them say &quot;oh yeah when our LDAP server has 20,000 users in (number made up) the admin tool for browsing gets really slow&quot;. Yep same thing.</p>

<p>Many times Alan Runyan is right, one talk in particular that stuck in head was a talk at the last New Orleans conference. At that he was asking people to focus on reusability, not re-invention (although his point was probably deeper than that). </p>

<p>And don&#39;t get me started on how Django is crippling itself with re-inventing yet another templating language and simultaneously natching defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>

<p><em>Side note:</em> Just to compound the problem in the Ruby on Rails app was that it was looking for a change on the input box every second and firing off a request to the server, returning a huge recordset every time. There&#39;s a reason Google doesn&#39;t have this on their home page you know.</p>

<p>Okay rant over, on with the show.</p>
