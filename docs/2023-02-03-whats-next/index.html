<h2><a href="/2023-02-03-whats-next/">What's next</a></h2>
<hr class="florished">
<p>As some of you may know, for the last few years I worked at GitHub as part of an amazing team building <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a>. I got to work on stuff that really did change how people build software. I was there from the re-invention after itâ€™s announcement (there were earlier days) until early 2022. I was immensely proud of Actions. When people ask what Iâ€™ve done in my career, the two biggest product achievements remain: moving Firefox over to WebExtensions and building GitHub Actions.</p>

<p>But last year it was time for a change. GitHub were kind enough to give me a extended holiday to think about things, hence all the <a href="https://mckay.pub/tags/trips/">2022 trips</a>. I came back and worked with the wonderful Dependabot team for a while, but alas it wasnâ€™t to be and I voluntarily moved on to the next thing.</p>

<h3 id="vercel">Vercel</h3>

<p>That next thing was <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> which I was excited about, moving to a smaller company focused on some things that I thought were interesting. However a few months later, it turns out that wasnâ€™t the place for me and I chose to leave.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not going to get into the details of why Vercel didnâ€™t work out for me, but suffice to say that the cultural fit was missing, along with a few other things. Thereâ€™s some really good people at Vercel building some very good stuff and I wish them only the best.</p>

<h3 id="timing">Timing</h3>

<p>Could timing be any worse? At the same time as I decide to leave Vercel so many other people around the technology world are also being laid off. Itâ€™s tough for so many people right now, but finding a full time job (that doesnâ€™t suck) right now is hard.</p>

<p>Good luck to everyone having to do that ðŸ’š and if I can help at all, please drop me a line.</p>

<p>At times like this its important to remember that organisations and the jobs are temporary. The people, the relationships and the connections are what last.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Iâ€™m not looking for another full time job at this time.</p>

<h3 id="back-to-my-roots">Back to my roots</h3>

<p>Before GitHub, there was Mozilla and before Mozilla there was open source work at a few different places. There was Plone (which is still going) and Django (still awesome) and Python (still my favourite language).</p>

<p>In those days had young daughters, was just starting my career and learning so much that it was tough. I quickly had to take jobs to pay the bills, do consulting and the thought of going a month without income was really hard and stressful. Iâ€™m sure many of you can relate to this ðŸ˜¢</p>

<p>But these days thanks to places like Mozilla and GitHub (and Microsoft for buying GitHub) the situation is different. Iâ€™m more secure financially and that gives me the freedom to do what I want in a work situation.</p>

<h3 id="so">Soâ€¦</h3>

<p>I see this as an amazing opportunity in life that I havenâ€™t had before. So over the next while:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Primarily: <strong>Iâ€™ll be focusing on missions I care about, the environment, cycling etc.</strong></li>
  <li>Iâ€™ll be aiming to build some projects and products.</li>
  <li>Consulting, advising and supporting where I can.</li>
  <li>Avoiding on-call rotations, because they are the worst.</li>
  <li>Spending a lot of time working on my running, cycling and hiking.</li>
  <li>Blogging a lot more.</li>
  <li>Connecting more with people.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thatâ€™s it, itâ€™s all about the mission and lifestyle.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not looking for work right now, unless itâ€™s something super awesome or special or I get to work closely with someone amazing from my past ðŸ‘‹ If so, drop me a line.</p>
