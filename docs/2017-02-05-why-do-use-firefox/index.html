<hr class="florished">
<p>If you read my blog, you probably know I’m helping looking after the move to WebExtensions as the way to develop add-ons for Firefox. We’ve received some positive interactions but regularly face critics and bruising (if not insulting and threatening) comments. It’s a tough job right now.</p>

<p>But one thing we hear repeatedly is this: “If you take away my Extensions as they exist today, I will just switch to Chrome”</p>

<p>That’s a question that keeps troubling me, because I care about Firefox. Here’s some points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>only about 38% of Firefox users have an extension [1]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>some of those add-ons with a large install base are defunct eg Microsoft .NET Helper and Firebug</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pretty much all the add-ons with a large install base [2] already exist on Chrome [3]</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So here’s my statement: the <strong>vast majority of users could switch to Chrome and get all the same extensions with almost identical functionality</strong> [4]. For a minority of users using extensions that do not exist in Chrome, you cannot. My guess at that number of users who cannot switch is well under 5% of our user base [5].</p>

<p>So some people will complain loudly and argue this is the death of Firefox. Whilst I can see this might cause a switch for some people, I haven’t yet seen the evidence behind this statement. To be frank, why haven’t you already switched to another browser?</p>

<p>The evidence tells me that Firefox <strong>must offer some benefits or value beyond just extensions</strong>. In fact it’s insulting to all those contributors who work so hard on Firefox to say that extensions are the only thing keeping them from switching to Chrome.</p>

<p>So what does keep you using Firefox?</p>

<p>[1] Some of these are based on numbers I’ve seen and its Sunday night after the Super Bowl and I’ve had a drink so this is might not be completely accurate.</p>

<p>[2] There are some exceptions here NoScript, DownThemAll etc.</p>

<p>[3] Some people argue that some add-ons are better on Firefox, e.g: Adblock Plus has more features on Firefox than Chrome. For other add-ons e.g: React Tools it’s not the case. Yet others argue that Adblock Plus is faster on Chrome than on Firefox and so on. Short answer: it’s complicated.</p>

<p>[4] Remember all they have to do is switch and install the equivalent Chrome extensions.</p>

<p>[5] That’s my guess. This is a number we are trying to figure out.</p>
