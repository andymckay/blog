<hr class="florished">
<p>There is an order to a complicated task and as you become an expert the order of doing those things change.</p>

<p>A few years ago I put up some shelves in my house. At one point, I noticed that the order I was doing it in changed from the past. I stained, varnished and screwed the brackets onto the shelves and then screwed them to the wall. It was fast and confidently done. Whereas in the past I&#39;d done it in a completely different order.</p>

<p>When I started out writing software I was very visually based. I&#39;d start out by figuring out how the page looked, then wrote the template, then the view and then the model and then maybe tests. It wasn&#39;t test driven development, it was &quot;how my brain works development&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="/files/order-before.png"></p>

<p>I wrote a book about developing Plone and I wrote the book in a similar order. As it turns out I think a lot of the people who were learning Plone did things in the same way, perhaps its the nature of Plone developers or perhaps thats the natural order when you don&#39;t know whats going.</p>

<p>As I did development more and more, one day I&#39;d noticed I&#39;d switched things around. My process had flipped and I had going the other way around. Starting at the &quot;bottom&quot; with the model and working my way up. Maybe it was &quot;test driven development&quot;.</p>

<p>Well lets face it, it is never that clean and simple. It&#39;s really more like this:</p>

<p>Peoples order of doing things changes due to many variables: from how people think, to how experienced people are. When I did training I was amazed to see that in a group of a dozen people I&#39;ll have a dozen different starting points. That&#39;s because I had a group of developers at different levels with different experiences.</p>

<p>There was one person who wanted to dive down into the lowest code you could imagine, I was worried they&#39;d never work their way up. Another who started at the templates and was doodling on a peice of paper. Everyone is different and everyone&#39;s flow is different.</p>

<p>Of course I chose a flow for my book and other authors choose a flow for their books. But I think you can probably guess that people less experienced in the process start with the least abstract view first. Maybe, I have to prove that point.</p>
