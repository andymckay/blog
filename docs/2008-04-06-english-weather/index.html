<p>English weather is even crazier than Vancouver weather! In Vancouver, I was well known for saying "If you don't like the weather, stick around. It'll change in 5 minutes!" Here in Garstang, it's more like 5 seconds!</p>

<p>Over the course of the winter, I think it "snowed" twice - and both times it was just a few flurries overnight, leaving not even enough snow on the ground to make a snowball. Then suddenly Easter weekend, we had some beautiful mornings followed by snow flurries in the afternoon 2 or 3 days in a row! Each time the snow started and got heavier, I thought, "This is it, it's really going to snow properly this time," only to have it stop and start several times and eventually give up. Most days since then have started out sunny and ended up with rain.</p>

<p>So this morning, I looked out the window to see beautiful clear blue sunny sky, so I decided to put on one of my spring dresses (which in Canada I would have been wearing since February) to go to church. I stepped outside to find that it was actually very cold, despite the sunshine. No time to change though, so off I went. After church, several people commented on how brave I was, to which I replied that it wasn't so bad until I went outside, and that it felt as if it might snow if there were some clouds in the sky.</p>

<p>Now keep in mind, this is April 6th. I wasn't at all serious about the possibility of it snowing. In fact I had planned on planting my tomato plants that I bought yesterday, along with some carrot and pea seeds this afternoon. So I was quite surprised when, after changing into more suitable gardening clothes, I looked out the window to find it was . . . you guessed it . . . SNOWING! Needless to say, I left my seed planting for a warmer day. I did, however, put my tomato plants into pots and Emily helped me prepare the bed for planting the seeds. I also bunged in a couple of potatoes and onions that were sprouting in my veggy basket - we'll see what happens with them!</p>

<p>So next time you ask me about the weather, don't be surprised if I say  "If you don't like the weather, stick around. It'll change in 5 seconds!"</p>

<p>P.S. Needless to say, the snow has given up once again and the sky has cleared. In any case this is the closest to my birthday that it has snowed - except the year I was in Quebec for my birthday and it snowed the day after it!
