<p>Of all the things that get my blood boiling as a cyclist is drivers who turn right directly in front of you. Fair enough, everyone has to turn right - but I just get incensed when drivers overtake, giving you lots of room, then instantly turn right blocking you completely. <em>Where is the cyclist meant to go</em>: left into the traffic, right around the front of the car, or hope you can brake in time before slamming into the car that is now braking.</p>

<p>This has happened to me several times. At least once Iâ€™ve been unable to stop, and splatted myself on the back of a nice expensive car, hopefully scratching it in the process. I think the mental process that goes through the drivers is something like this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>There's my right turn up ahead</li>
	<li>Oh there's a cyclist I'll can just speed past him</li>
	<li>He's behind me now, not my problem, let's turn right</li>
</ul>

<p>Things theyâ€™ve forgotten: 1) there could be a pedestrian, car parking or other obstacle causing them to stop 2) cyclists canâ€™t stop as fast as cars. All they had to do was slow downâ€¦ wait for the cyclist to pass then turn right or ensure they had left enough space up ahead.</p>

<p>Please drivers, <strong>slow down</strong> and give us room.</p>

<p>Rant over. And watch out Mr. Brown Chevy Minivan, donâ€™t do that too me again.</p>
