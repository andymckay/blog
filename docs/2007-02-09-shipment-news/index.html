<hr class="florished">
<p>January 30th<br /><br />OK, so I thought it would take another week or so from the ship landing for our stuff to arrive. Ha! We got a letter, just before the ship was due to dock, explaining that the ship should dock on the 21st and that it would take about a week for the cargo to arrive at the London sorting warehouse, at which point they would contact us to arrange delivery. Well, I phoned today - 9 days after docking - to find out what was happening and was told, "It arrived in the warehouse this morning. Depending on where you are, it will take 1 to 3 weeks to clear customs and be delivered." You can bet I was REALLY happy to hear that - NOT! That makes estimated time not 22-24 days as I was told beforehand, but 8-10 weeks!</p>
