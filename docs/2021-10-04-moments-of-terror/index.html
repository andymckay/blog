<p>We know that British Columbia, by way of the Motor Vehicle Act, is not a province that supports cycling. Generally cycling here is one that involves moments of terror and then real terror depending upon the lack of infrastructure you face cycling.</p>

<p>Here’s some examples.</p>

<h3 id="britannia-beach">Britannia Beach</h3>

<p>If you cycle the sea to sky you will <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@49.636184,-123.2112272,3a,75y,40.89h,73.98t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s0EcERbAEh5IO4b8YiZ47uQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192">find this on the road out of Britannia Beach</a>. That’s where the shoulder for cycling goes instantly with <strong>no signs</strong> or warning down to zero.</p>

<p><img src="/files/britannia-beach.png" /></p>

<p>Cyclists are forced straight out into traffic. There’s no signs, no warning to cyclists or drivers. It’s on a right hand bend, so you are forced to cycle around the bend in the lane, where cars are doing 90 km/h. That means cars can’t actually see you as they go around the bend. Sheer terror.</p>

<h3 id="porteau-cove">Porteau Cove</h3>

<p>At Porteau Cove there are lots of signs and warning to both cyclists and drivers this is happening. Its a less sharp right hand bend and I normally hit this at 40km/h+ on a bike.</p>

<p><img src="/files/porteau-cove.png" /></p>

<p>So what does “Share the road” mean? Well because BC has no passing distance, I was cycling through this section at 40km/h a feet or two into the lane when a bus decided to pass me at 80km/h+. <strong>I was able to reach out my left arm and hit the bus</strong>. That’s how close it was.</p>

<h3 id="seymour-parkway">Seymour Parkway</h3>

<p>How about the Seymour Parkway. There’s a bike lane, great. Highlighted with red arrow (and yes that’s a truck crossing it). Before that there’s no bike lane because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>there’s a right turn lane for cars</li>
  <li>a lump of concrete with some signs</li>
  <li>a bus stop</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/files/seymour-parkway-1.png" /></p>

<p>before that…</p>

<p><img src="/files/seymour-parkway-2.png" /></p>

<p>This is a designated ICBC bike route, that ICBC wants to ride to avoid anatagonising drivers (yes, it’s all cyclists fault)… and again you have to swerve out into the road.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are many moments of terror cycling because cycling infrastructure when it does occur is on a block by block basis and done with the minimal amount of cost and inconvenience to drivers.</p>
