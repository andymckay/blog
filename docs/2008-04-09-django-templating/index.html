<hr class="florished">
<p>This comment from the Django documentation was pointed out to me tonight and it winds me up a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
Why use a text-based template instead of an XML-based one (like Zopes TAL)? We wanted Djangos template language to be usable for more than just XML/HTML templates. At World Online, we use it for e-mails, JavaScript and CSV. You can use the template language for any text-based format.
<br /><br />
Oh, and one more thing: Making humans edit XML is sadistic!

<p>There's a few things in this comment that annoy me.</p>
<p>Most websites are written as HTML. Almost every site these days is XHTML. And XHTML is "A Reformulation of HTML 4 in XML 1.0". At this point yes I'm aware, XHTML isn't quite XML as this <a href="http://webkit.org/blog/68/understanding-html-xml-and-xhtml/">article points out</a>, but it's as near as damn it. Everyone writes XHMTL these days. In fact look at the heading HTML of the Django admin interface:</p>
<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
 lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us" &gt;
</pre>
<p>So how can you write an interface in XHTML and claim that forcing people to write in XML is sadistic? The difference is so small to be neglible..</p>
<p>Next, you use it for "e-mails, JavaScript and CSV". Excellent, I put together sites using XHTML, Ajax (XML), RSS (XML), e-mail, Javascript, CSV's and PDF's. I've almost never, in the many sites I've done, started formatting Javascript, CSV's or PDF's using a templating language - the only exception I can think of is DTML which CMF and Plone (and I didn't write it).</p>
<p>In fact in Plone e-mails are formed using Page Templates, here's a snippet:</p>
<pre>
From: "&lt;span tal:replace="portal/email_from_name" /&gt;" 
&lt;span tal:replace="structure lt"/&gt;&lt;span tal:replace="portal/email_from_address" /&gt;
&lt;span tal:replace="structure gt"/&gt;
</pre>
<p><cite><a href="https://svn.plone.org/svn/plone/CMFPlone/branches/2.5/skins/plone_templates/mail_password_template.pt">mail_password_template</a> line breaks added for readability</cite></p>
<p>I would accept that is a little complicated and personally I've always found using python string formatting (the % operator) more than sufficient. So we don't need Django templating for that either. But let's face it, in most sites I have done, 95% of the templating demands are for HTML. I bet yours are too. So focus on what you need to do the most and build good tools that allow you to do it fast and simply with great flexibility.</p>
<p>Throwing out a great tool for an edge case, which it allegedly can't meet, is not a good answer. There's better reasons for not using Page Templates and I bet in any feature comparison, Page Templates would beat Django templates. Just say "I don't like Page Templates, it's ok".</p>
