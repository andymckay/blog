<p>In the process of shipping Firefox 57, we found a couple of things out about bugs and Bugzilla.</p>

<p><img src="https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/197/197451.png?modified=1518215572" style="float:right" /></p>

<p>There are an awful lot of bugs filed against Firefox and all it’s components in the course of a release. Keeping on top of that is hard and some teams have adopted some policies to help with that (for example see: design-decision-needed).</p>

<p>Having a consistent approach to bugs across the organisation makes it a little easier for everyone to get a feel for what’s going.</p>

<p>Sometimes the burden of setting all the right values can be tiring and prone to error. For example: setting a bug to P1 could involve the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>changing the priority</li>
  <li>setting the right flag for Firefox version</li>
  <li>changing the status</li>
  <li>turning off the cc flag</li>
  <li>setting a whiteboard value</li>
</ul>

<p>In Austin, we had a chat about this and it was suggested we make a tool to provide a consistent approach to this. A few weeks later I threw Bugzilla Triage Helper onto <a href="https://github.com/andymckay/bugzilla-triage-helper">Github</a> and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bugzilla-triage-helper/">addons.mozilla.org</a>. This tool is a content script that inserts an overlay onto Bugzilla.</p>

<p>This gives you a simple button (or keyboard shortcut) that does all of the above. It will even submit the bug for you so you can get on to the next bug.</p>

<p>Of course, it turns out that everyone’s workflow is slightly different. So I recently added the ability to add “additional” actions. These are dynamically looked by the product and component. They are specified in JS in the repo, so triage owners who want a slightly different wrinkle on the flow can alter that on github.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one team sets a blocking bug number of each bug that blocks release, so they’ve extended P1 to do that.</li>
  <li>one team has 5 or 6 common replies asking for more information and informing the user on how to get that information. So they’ve extended the “Canned” response option to select those.</li>
</ul>

<p>The extension is a content script that alters the DOM, which means its full of icky DOM code to manipulate the UI. I could do this through the API, but there’s a couple of reasons I do it in the UI:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I really don’t want to build a new UI to Bugzilla</li>
  <li>most people triaging are looking at the bug in the UI</li>
  <li>a user might want to add more to the bug not captured in the tool in ad hoc process</li>
  <li>Bugzilla has lots of things like mid-air collision detection, recursive blocking and so on that are surfaced in the UI</li>
  <li>see the first point again</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I’m starting to use it in some triages and I hope others will too and give me some feedback or even better some patches.</p>
