<hr class="florished">
<p>Following up on my <a href="https://mckay.pub/2023-02-03-whats-next/">what’s next</a> I wanted to post a little about what I have been doing.</p>

<h2 id="actions-analyser">Actions Analyser</h2>

<p>This is a <a href="https://analyser.clearwind.ca/">hosted way to dive into your Actions billing reports</a> and find out some important infomation like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>which repository in my organisation is consuming the most minutes</li>
  <li>which workflow within a repository is consuming the most minutes</li>
  <li>whats the change month over month</li>
  <li>variability in billings of workflows</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s completely free, you should check it out if you get an Actions bill and aren’t sure where the money is going.</p>

<h2 id="service-catalog">Service Catalog</h2>

<p>This is an <a href="https://github.com/clearwind-ca/service-catalog">open source project</a> to provide a way to track teams, applications and tools across an organisation. A similar tool was used a lot at GitHub and was being built at Vercel when I was there.</p>

<p>Combined with things like <a href="https://github.com/andymckay/service-status-cli">service status cli</a>, my goal is to provide tooling to make services more robust and transparent when they go wrong.</p>

<p>Lots to do here before we can hit anything like an initial release, but it’s a fun project so far.</p>

<h2 id="contracting">Contracting</h2>

<p>I’ve gotten back into <a href="https://clearwind.ca">contracting</a> with my first project for an awesome local client in a very long time. It’s converting Excel spreadsheets for some business needs and doing it all in the browser. I’ll write up a blog post on that soon, but doing it client side in the browser has been such a win for this project.</p>

<p>I’m open to more contracting or consulting opportunities, so if you know of any, please <a href="mailto:andy@mckay.pub">let me know</a>.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-cars">Beyond cars</h2>

<p><a href="https://beyondcars.ca/">Beyond cars is a blog to advocate for cycling</a>, mostly focused on BC. But hopefully relevant everywhere. This has been fun, there’s so much to write on the subject and my list of things to write about is bigger than I can keep up with.</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>A few months into this new phase of life, I’m enjoying things but realise that a lot of things have changed since I last did this. Back then I was heavily involved in Plone, Django and Python communities. The result was I received lots of contracts, opportunities and connections.</p>

<p>At the moment I feel quite disconnected from those communities and hence oppportunities. This is something I’m going to have to work on.</p>
