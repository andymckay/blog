<hr class="florished">
<p>If you work in IT in Canada then the chances are, you work with US companies. In fact for the majority of my career I have worked with US companies either full time, or as a contractor. Currently I work for <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/01/28/us-immigration-ban/">Mozilla</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years a key factor in my job has been the ability to travel to the US. Meetings, conferences and the so on are regular occurances in my career - meaning I travel to the US a couple of times a year. The majority of recruiting pings I get are from the big US tech companies who all require relocation to the US. A majority (not all) of career growth opportunities for me now are in the US, not Canada.</p>

<p>And now they are getting to the point where they might <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/29/politics/donald-trump-immigrant-policy-social-media-contacts/index.html">start checking cell phones and social media posts</a> to vet incoming visitors. People who wanted to attend the <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/01/21/canadians-headed-to-womens-march-turned-away-at-us-border.html">Womens march</a> were turned away.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been critical of the current US government on this blog and on Twitter and now it comes to a simple choice: will I keep quiet in the hope that I will still be able to cross the border at a future date? No. It might cost me, but this is worth fighting about.</p>
