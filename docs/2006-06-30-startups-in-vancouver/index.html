<hr class="florished">
<p>Just found this post on <a href="http://www.bmannconsulting.com/blog/bmann/vancouver-is-a-fine-place-to-start-a-company-or-to-join-one">Brian’s blog</a> and its so good I’ll reiterate it here, where Jeff Griffiths comments on <a href="http://anisotropic.net/caterinas_take_on_starting_a_company_in_the_valley">starting Flickr in Vancouver</a>:</p>

<blockquote>I would go even further and say that one of the critical success factors for Flickr *was* that they were not just 'toiling in obscurity', but that they were IN Vancouver. Up here we have lots of talent, a relatively low cost of living ( compared to the valley at least ), and all sorts of added lifestyle bonuses that San jose will never beat ( climbing / biking / snowboarding / music ).

And for Flickr in particular, a major part of their early success was a loyal local following of users; witness the hugeness of the Vancouver tag. I would smugly theorize that Flickr's ability to find their users was helped in a large way by their being in Vancouver, a city that seems to breed tech-obsessed shutterbugs more than most places.

I dunno, I think it's probably a bad time to start a company in San Jose, but it's hard to say when that would ever be true given Caterina's qualifications. Vancouver, on the other hand, seems to be a fine place to ( re ) start a company... </blockquote>

<p>At the time I of course would have pointed out that Enfold was another company in that list that’s running in Vancouver and hiring. Since that’s not the case, point moot. However I spent many times it seems saying “No I’m not moving to <a href="http://www.finfacts.com/qualityoflife.htm">Houston</a>*” I love it here. I still do and I think its a great place to start a company.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Houston is the lowest ranked city in US (68), Vancouver the highest in North America (3). We’ve heard this one many times before anyway.</li>
</ul>
