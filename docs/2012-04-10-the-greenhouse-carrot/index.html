<p>As B.C. residents know the Liberal Government introduced a carbon tax in July of 2008 which is applied to virtually all fossil fuels, most notably gas. The goal was to:</p>

<blockquote>find a way that we can work towards improving our environment</blockquote>

<p><cite><a href="http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=ecea1487-507c-43ef-ab88-5a972898e0b7">Carole Taylor</a></cite>
<p>Personally I don&#39;t have a problem with a carbon tax as long as it&#39;s used to support transit or support non-fossil fuel solutions through tax credits. Weaning our economy off of fossil fuels makes sense for our economy and environment.</p>
<p>Or, instead, just to buy votes. There&#39;s an upcoming by-election in Chilliwack-Hope, an area with a large agricultural base. One in which the Liberals have no hope of winning. So what did they do for:</p>
<blockquote>the most innovative, technically advanced and sustainably managed producers in the world</blockquote>
<cite><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/bc-politics/the-greenhouse-effect-of-bcs-carbon-tax-plan/article2392571/">Don McRae</a></cite>
<p>They announced:</p>
<blockquote>new tax relief will in effect eliminate for one year the cost of the carbon tax for greenhouse growers on propane and natural gas</blockquote>
<cite><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/bc-politics/the-greenhouse-effect-of-bcs-carbon-tax-plan/article2392571/">Globe and Mail</a></cite>
<p>Because:</p>
<blockquote>Greenhouse growers said the tax relief will enable them to be more competitive with producers in the United States and Mexico</blockquote>
<cite><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/bc-politics/the-greenhouse-effect-of-bcs-carbon-tax-plan/article2392571/">Globe and Mail</a></cite>
<p>Which seems to defeat the point of the carbon tax. Of course, if the greenhouse growers were so innovative, couldn&#39;t they work around the carbon tax which has been in place for 4 years?</p>
<p>It&#39;s just an excuse to redirect our tax money to buy votes. And now they have announced that they:</p>
<blockquote>the tax will then be frozen while the government conducts a review to determine its impact on B.C.&#39;s economy</blockquote>
<cite><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/02/22/bc-carbon-tax-review.html">CBC</a></cite>
<p>With a focus on:</p>
<blockquote>how the carbon tax is increasing our economic competitiveness both on the positive side and the negative side</blockquote>
<cite><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/02/22/bc-carbon-tax-review.html">CBC</a></cite>
<p>So here we&#39;ve got a simple review structure in place that will allow them to phrase a result that makes the carbon tax an inefficient drag on businesses. But of course you can&#39;t remove the tax quickly, it will be a carrot for voting in the Liberals at the next general election. Vote us in, gas prices go down.</p>
<p>Will be interesting to see how the NDP play this.</p></p>
