        <p class="my-3 ">
            <p>When I started seriously backpacking I got a <a href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-06-tracker.html">Spot Gen 4 in 2022</a>. The Spot was a wonderful device that provided a level of security for me and reassurance for my wife. It allowed me to roam further and with more confidence, knowing that if things go really bad there's a button to press that would send a message for help. It made me more confident and more comfortable hiking on my own. I wouldn't have done a lot of the hikes on this blog without it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Spot had a few issues and recently it started to act erractically. The battery light would come on just an hour or so after fresh batteries were put in. Messages that I tried to send didn't seem to be going through. The one thing I need in this device is relability, everything else is secondary. Just before some big hikes, I decided I needed to replace it.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">🚨 Garmin is a US company 🤦‍♂, so Canadian 🇨🇦 buyers beware. I bought this in 2025, well aware of the companies location, but unfortunately it's the best choice.</div>

<p>One thing my wife and I decided upon is that we'd like to have two way messaging in a device. For the simple reasons that when I press the SOS button, any context or information we can share is useful. For example: the difference between me pressing the SOS button because I've broken my leg and because I've come across another hiker with a broken leg is quite important.</p>
<p>So what were my options?</p>
<h3 id="another-spot">Another Spot?</h3>
<p>There were things I didn't like about the Spot Gen 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>The battery life was good and required carrying batteries 👍</li>
<li>A lack of information. For example, there's no battery level indicator, just green "ok" and red "replace" 👎</li>
<li>No two way messaging 👎</li>
<li>It's rather big and bulky to strap on the outside of backpacks and the velcro strap sucked 👎</li>
<li>It's a US company 👎</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a <a href="https://www.findmespot.com/en-us/products-services/spot-x">Spot X</a> which provides two way messaging, but it seems like a Blackberry with it's keyboard. The reviews of it are not good. It's not small or light either (198.4g). If I'm going to pay money to a US company, it better be good.</p>
<h3 id="how-about-zoleo">How about Zoleo?</h3>
<p>Zoleo is a Canadian company, yay 😻. The <a href="https://www.zoleo.com/en-ca">Zoleo</a> is a bulky box with some lights, reminiscient of the Spot Gen 4. It does have two way messaging and an app. The problems with the Zoleo were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>No where local sold them, both Valhalla and MEC had none for sale. I could order online and get one in a week or more (plus shipping) 👎 👎</li>
<li>It looks even more big, bulky and ugly than a Spot Gen 4 👎</li>
<li>It isn't super light 👎 (150g)</li>
<li>It does have a long battery life 👍</li>
<li>It is a Canadian company 👍</li>
<li>It's a relatively cheap device ($250 CAD) 👍</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that I couldn't get one in time for my next hikes was the deal breaker, but I admit the thought of having another bulky box didn't fill me with joy.</p>
<h3 id="how-about-just-my-phone">How about just my phone?</h3>
<p>The iPhone 14 and upwards come with Satellite messaging. I've used it a couple of times and it works in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120930">North America</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Messages via satellite is available in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It's free for two years after the activation of an iPhone 14 or later (all models).</blockquote>

<p>That's pretty generous and will cover 90% of my use cases, although we do travel outside of those areas frequently. I'm not sure how much it costs after the two years though.</p>
<p>In practice however, I've found it very finnicky to use. It didn't work well under tree cover, it didn't work on the West Coast Trail when a US cell tower could be reached (which I couldn't use), it didn't work well down in a valley surrounded by mountains.</p>
<p>The phone is one of the most important devices while hiking. I use it for pictures, a map, it has a weak backup flashlight (always carry a dedicated flashlight) and in an <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/north-shore-rescue-lifeseeker-portable-cell-tower-1.7639677">emergency can be used to find you</a>. But that means it's batteries run down and having a dedicated device for that emergency is important to me. But also, in an emergency I really don't want to be having to move to a spot with no trees, or turning my iPhone around to find a satellite.</p>
<h3 id="garmin-inreach">Garmin inReach</h3>
<p>If you ever see a device on the trail, it's likely a Garmin. I've had multiple Garmin devices and I've pretty much disliked them all. The software is terrible and Garmin will find any way to charge you more. However the inReach does everything I want:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's small and light 👍 (100g)</li>
<li>It's got a long battery life 👍</li>
<li>It has an app, and clear indicators about what's happening 👍</li>
<li>It is able to send messages in situations an iPhone can't 👍</li>
<li>It's an expensive device ($579 CAD) 👎</li>
<li>It's from a US company 👎</li>
</ul>
<p>On my first hike out, I came back raving about how much more I liked the inReach. It's small - it fit into my backpack front pockets easily. It has a screw so I can attach it to my camera mount. I can look and see how much battery life is remaining easily. Checkin messages are clearer than the Spot. </p>
<p>Unlike the iPhone I don't need to do a lot of manual steps to send a message. I just queue it up, clip my inReach back in and continue hiking. In a few minutes I'll get an audible notification when it's gone.</p>
<p>I was able to find it on sale at $399 CAD. That was still way more expensive than the other options, but let's talk about plans... 👇</p>
<h3 id="the-plans">The plans</h3>
<p>When buying a device, you need to consider the recurring plan that you need. The Spot Gen 4 was costing me ~$12 a month and there were no extra message charges, but also no two way messaging anyway. The cheapest Zoleo plan is $25 CAD a month and that includes 75 messages, with unlimited check-in messages. The cheapest Garmin plan is $10.99 CAD a month. Messages vary from 15c to 70c.</p>

<p>In September I did 5 hikes with the Garmin and I overused it a bit. I sent 19 check in messages, 1 weather message, 8 text messages, so my total cost was $21.23 CAD. Those 27 messages still costs less than the Zoleo plan.</p>
<p>In October I plan on doing no overnight hikes, so my total cast is expected to be $10.99 CAD.</p>
<p>The Garmin cost $150 more than the Zoleo, but in roughly (depending upon usage) one year, the plan for the Garmin will have made up for the Zoleo cost difference. I note this calculation was helped by the Garmin being on sale.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>I ❤️ the Garmin inReach. After four days on the Rockwall in the Rockies, my battery was at 75% and I'd gotten a weather report and sent a bunch of messages to my wife. It's small, lightweight and fits perfectly in my loadout. The plan fits with my hiking schedule of busy and quiet months. I would fully recommend it. The downside is that the original unit <em>is expensive</em> (we know it will get bashed or broken at some point) and I'm paying money to a US company.</p>
