<hr class="florished">
<p>Dear Plone,</p>

<p>I'm sorry what I said about you today and I wanted to write a note to apologise. Perhaps it's just me, in fact I know it's me. It's not you, I'm just not good enough for you.</p>

<p>I know recently I've been flirting a bit with Rails, but that's over now, we won't be seeing each other again. Yes you've found out I've been seeing Django and I have to admit, it will always have a special place for me. I like to think that we are big enough to able to allow others into our relationship and from this we can grow.</p>

<p>You've taken me many places. When it's good, it's good. It's like a dance, we fly together across the dance floor in harmony, creating beautiful things whilst other frameworks look on with envy from the sides.</p>

<p>But then today, we had a bad day and it's my fault. I had no idea that fiddling with setup was so fragile. Sometimes I wish you would complain and let me know what the problem was, a relationship thrives on communication. If you don't tell me the problem, how can I help? And when do you complain, can you make it a little clearer? What's with this bizarre error about getActionObject of DynamicViewTypeInformation being marked as private and why can't I put .cpt's in browser views and why is my Zope 3 style content type about 20x the size of my old one and why when I pdb into eggs do I get sent into /home/steve which doesn't exist and...</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I'm off again.</p>

<p>I hope you can forgive me for the neglect I've given you over the last year or so. It's been a while since we've done anything new and exciting together. I'll try to be a better person and get things right more often. We can save this relationship if we both work at it and I'll keep trying.</p>

<p>Hugs and see you in the morning.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> the next day was a good one.</p>
