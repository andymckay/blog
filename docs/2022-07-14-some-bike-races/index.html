<p>Some of the bike races I did this year, so far</p>

<h3 id="valley-fondo">Valley Fondo</h3>

<p>I registered for the this Fondo in 2020 so my registration was a roll-over from that.</p>

<p>Normally this starts in the middle of Fort Langley, but this time it started in a muddy field nearby.</p>

<p>I found this race tough for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I forgot to take pills that control my heart rate and so had to stop a couple of times</li>
  <li>My back started to hurt really early in the race and didnâ€™t get better</li>
  <li>I got some good drafts, but struggled on hills and lost groups</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I find the race goes around nice parts of the valley. But I struggled to get a real sense of where I was, where I was going and so on. It just felt like I was cycling around in circles (I was). I was extremely glad that this race finished quite short.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d probably not do this race again.</p>

<h3 id="cowichan-crusher">Cowichan Crusher</h3>

<p>I registered for this at the last minute and made it into a camping trip and did 120km the day before to get there. Most of the information is over in <a href="https://mckay.pub/2022-06-07-south-vancouver-island/">this post</a>. Itâ€™s nice to do a gravel race for a change and I wasnâ€™t aiming for anything good here, just to have fun.</p>

<h3 id="okanagan-fondo">Okanagan Fondo</h3>

<p>Another hold over from 2020, this is my second time doing this Fondo. It happens to fall the day after my birthday and I really enjoy the Okanagan. After my experience in the Valley Fondo and my complete lack of cycling with Steed this year, I expected to go into this one and struggle.</p>

<p>It turns out I didnâ€™t struggle this time. My back didnâ€™t hurt until about 140km or so, usual for a long bike ride. My heart stayed under control and the weather was good. All the way south I was able to get into good groups and share pulling with some good drafts.</p>

<p>I was saving some energy for the hill at 110km, because that totally destroyed me last time and after that I was spent. Not so this time, it was tough, but nowhere as near as bad as I remembered. It did cause my average speed to drop below 32km/h, but as I approached and passed the observatory, I was able to start increasing my average speed above 30km a bit.</p>

<p>At this point I started realising I could land this in under 5 hours, at an average pace over 30km/hâ€¦ and I did hitting PRs on most of the route.</p>

<p>This one felt good and Iâ€™d love to come back and do it again.</p>
