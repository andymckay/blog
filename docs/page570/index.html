<h2><a href="/2024-06-17-a-backpack/" class="posturl">A backpack</a></h2>
<hr class="florished">
<p>In recent years Iâ€™ve upgraded some of my gear as I get more into backpacking, with things like a <a href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-04-a-tent/">new tent</a>, <a href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-05-sleeping-bag/">sleeping bag</a> and so on. One thing I hadnâ€™t done was look seriously at my backpack which Iâ€™d just bought at MEC for a trip around Europe because it seemed ok. I was thinking I needed something lighter and more comfortable. So I went to <a href="https://vpo.ca/">Valhalla Pure Outfitters</a> (thereâ€™s one in North Vancouver now) and one of my old running mates works there and was able to give me some great detailed advice. And hereâ€™s what I got: the <a href="https://www.osprey.com/talontm-velocity-30?color=Dark%2520Charcoal%2520Tumbleweed%2520Yellow">Osprey Talon Velocity 30L</a> and I ðŸ’š it.</p>

<p><img src="/files/talon.png" height="400px" /></p>

<p>Thereâ€™s attention to detail on this pack that Iâ€™ve not seen on any of my other bags. All the straps have bits to stop them flapping. The side pockets can be accessed from the top and side - its easy to reach around and grab something without taking it off. The front straps are wide meaning its comfortable against my body.</p>

<p>Most importantly, this backpack is well fitting and barely feels like Iâ€™m carrying any weight at all. The slim but tall profile means that my centre of gravity is close to be body. Weight is well distributed onto my hips. Honestly a lot of time it feels like Iâ€™m barely carrying any weight. Iâ€™ve done multiple 5+ hour hikes with it so far and havenâ€™t really noticed the weight.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s enough space that I can carry all my day gear, the ten essentials, all my overnight gear and spare clothes and food in it with ease. It has been a game changer. It turns out itâ€™s not super light at 990g (but thatâ€™s 160g lighter than my last) but itâ€™s so well designed and comfortable, I canâ€™t imagine wanting anything else at this point.</p>

<p>This has enabled me to easily carry emergency overnight gear on all my hikes, without any penalty. Even if I donâ€™t plan on staying overnight, I can now comfortably hike the North Shore knowing that if a problem occurs, or I just run out of light, I can just settle in for the night and resume my hike the next day. That feels like the safest way to hike and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m really happy with this pack.</p>

<p>This now means Iâ€™ve got:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A small 5L Salomon running pack for runs.</li>
  <li>A small 10L Salomon running pack for day hikes.</li>
  <li>A 30L Osprey backpack for long hikes or a few days of backpacking.</li>
  <li>A 40L MEC backpack for longer backpacking trips.</li>
  <li>A 65L Arcteryx monster backpack for when I want to carry the world and hate myself.</li>
</ul>
