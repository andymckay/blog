<hr class="florished">
<p>Today the Guardian has articles on <a href="http://environment.guardian.co.uk/travel/story/0,,2010910,00.html" target="_blank">road congestion</a> and flexible working arrangements, but does not connect the two.<div><br /></div><div>A bit solution to commuting and congestion is simple, make more tele-commuters. Commuting is evil in pretty much every sense, its damage to the environment and to the people involved<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3761012.stm" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2984923.stm" target="_blank">2</a>, etc... Most people commute into work and due to lack of flexibility this exacts a huge toll on everyone, including the employer (lower productivity, unhappier employees and sicker employeers) the originator of the problem.<div><br /></div><div>Now admittedly, not everyone can commute. Manual labourers for example. A couple of employees whom I told to work at home a few days a week, just couldn&#39;t, there were way too many distractions. But take a scenario where 20% of the workfoce works at home (or a very close office) and then spends 1-2 days a week in the office doing meetings and the such. It&#39;s incredibly useful to have that together face time, essential in fact.</div><div><br /></div><div>The problem I&#39;ve seen, is from managers. The less enlightened managers (which I&#39;m glad to say I haven&#39;t had for a looong time) like to see people working. By this they think people should be sat at a desk. People should be at their desks &quot;working&quot; where the manager can keep an eye on them. This is of course completely pointless and useless, doesn&#39;t accurately reflect people&#39;s productivity and is just a matter of re assuring the manager.</div><div><br /></div><div>But making 20% of the workforce work at home 3-4 days a week would have an absolutely huge effect on congestion and the amount of damage. If I was a true blogger I would probably have to go and find some numbers to back this up.</div><div><br /></div><div>Businesses adapt now, because it would be better to adapt on your terms rather than waiting for the environmental backlash hit and your employees are up a creek. In 20 years time, commuting will be very hard. In 10 years time it might be too. In 5 years who knows. We can solve the problem by adapting business.</div></div></p>
