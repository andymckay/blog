<h2><a href="/2014-05-20-front/">Front end complexities</a></h2>
<hr class="florished">
<p>There are many sins in recruiting. One of them is the broad categorisation of
developers as front or back-end. But for that a new trend has been emerging and
will continue to get stronger, a <a href="https://mckay.pub.ca/2013-11-26-node/">front-end developer</a> encompasses a lot of
skill sets and can’t be easily classified.</p>

<p>Traditionally you take a site by getting some HTML, returning it from a server
and slapping some HTML, JS and CSS on it. For this you’d expect a front-end
developer to be heavily presentation oriented and wield CSS like a mighty
sword.</p>

<p>But these days you’ll see a lot more apps
where the main work is done in the client and the server is just an API to
return data (if one exists at all). Yet still developers are broadly placed
into a bucket as a “front-end developer”.
In a world where lots of the logic and presentation is done in the front-end,
does that make sense?</p>

<p>Take a good developer who can take data from multiple
sources, store and sort it efficiently, test it well and have it accessible in
a good API.  So, does that describe a task on the front or back-end?</p>

<p>That could just as easily be a developer working on the back-end as a developer
working in the front-end. You need to build, or use an existing framework to
do all that on the front-end. For that you don’t need to do any
presentation or CSS work.</p>

<p>So when you think of hiring a “front-end” developer, think more
importantly about what you expect that person to be doing: frameworks,
presentation, performance, localisation, data… the list goes on.</p>
