<p>This last week I sent in a pair of pull requests to remove the terms <em>whitelist</em> and <em>blacklist</em> from a couple of our repositories. You might scoff a such a pull request and a while back I would probably have been one of the first to question such a pull request, but my views on this have been changing.</p>

<p>Personally, several things came up recently. I play Dominion with my two daughters and wife. All the cards in Dominion refer to male players. <em>He</em> and <em>him</em> throughout. Apparently they were gender neutral at the beginning and <a href="http://forum.dominionstrategy.com/index.php?topic=5799.420;wap2">Rio Grande Games</a> changed them to be male. Now they just annoy me.</p>

<p>A colleague of mine, the awesome Chris Karlof, writes all his use cases, bugs and documentation defaulting to a female perspective. Throughout the use cases it refers to actions <em>she</em> takes. Then earlier in 2014 there were multiple pull requests in <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/2692">Django</a> and other projects that tackled these terms and <a href="https://www.joyent.com/blog/the-power-of-a-pronoun">gender bias</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I support the Washington Redskins (go <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=redskins+rg+iii&amp;biw=1124&amp;bih=656&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HBiuVInMKsnkoASx3ILwAQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg">RG III</a>), have done for many years. But I wish they’d change their name (and get a new owner), I’ve met enough people now who are offended by it.</p>

<p>Finally, I decided it was time to make some changes and started making small changes to our code bases. First off I commented on a few pull requests that there might be better terms for <em>whitelist</em>. Then I started changing our code bases. Interestingly enough on the way, I realised I was the person who had introduced those terms in a few places.</p>

<p>When you think about it there are probably better terms. For example: <em>email_whitelist</em> became <em>emails_allowed</em>, <em>tag_blacklist</em> became <em>tags_blocked</em>. In pretty much every case there is a better word that is: 1) more descriptive and  2) shorter. That’s a win.</p>

<p>You could use things like <em>allowlist</em> or <em>denylist</em>, but unless you are particularly fond of Hungarian notation why have <em>list</em> in there at all? Just use a variable that reads well.</p>

<h3>Will this make a big difference?</h3>

<p>Of course not, I’m not pretending it will. I can’t point to studies or anything proving offence. But I can look at my code base with a little bit more pride and think that it sets a decent example.</p>

<h3>Where does it end?</h3>

<p>I can’t predict what’s offensive in every culture and every person in the future. Using that as an excuse to not make the change is lame. I’m just a simple person trying to do something right. Certainly something new will come up and we’ll adapt when it happens. We’ll be listening and that’s important.</p>

<h3>Haven't we got better things to do?</h3>

<p>Yep, we all do. But if you’ve got 5 minutes or see something that might be offensive, clean it up. It’s easy to always play the “too busy” card and never fix things.</p>

<p>So if you see something you could make a little better as you make changes, just give it a go. If you are feeling brave you could tackle <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=whitelist">this</a> or <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=blacklist">this</a>.</p>

<p>At Mozilla, I’m recognizing that we have a diverse multi-cultural team and inclusive team. I’m proud of that and want to support it. After all: <strong>Doing good is part of our code</strong>. Literally.</p>
