<p>Today marks five years at Mozilla. On such days people normally write blog posts about the things they’ve accomplished. I want to take a slightly different tack. Recently I was asked in an interview, by a prospective hire:</p>

<p>“Where will you be in five years time, will you still be at Mozilla?”</p>

<p>It was quite an interesting question for an interviewee to ask, and I had to think about it for moment. My answer was this…</p>

<p>“Honestly, I don’t know, maybe. In my career I’ve changed jobs every two years, this is the longest I’ve worked anywhere - I normally get bored.”</p>

<p>I then listed why I’ve been at Mozilla five years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A mission</strong>: that I can believe in, the Mozilla mission. Sure, it’s got rough days when things don’t make sense, but overall the idea is a good one and I’d like to help out.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Awesome people</strong>: everyday I interact with new and great people. <strong>Seriously</strong>. Just recently I started working with <a href="https://twitter.com/mozkev">Kev Needham</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/campd">Dave Camp</a> a lot. What do you know, they’ve been great. There are very, very few people at Mozilla who haven’t been absolutely great… and if they aren’t, they don’t stick around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enough freedom</strong>: to spend some time going off and doing something I want to do without asking for permission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Interesting problems</strong>: a reasonably wide variety of interesting problems that I enjoy solving. Coupled with above, the only thing stopping you fixing something is yourself. To borrow a quote from Facebook: <strong>“Nothing at Mozilla is someone else’s problem”</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Career growth</strong>: I’ve moved from being the new developer to taking on more responsibility, to moving into management and then moving up management.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Career challenge</strong>: I’ve moved way outside my comfort zone into working on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">Add-ons</a> and on Firefox itself. A good challenge, something interesting and something new.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No dread</strong>: I don’t dread coming in on Monday like I have on other jobs. I enjoy it, I have optimism about all the great things we can accomplish that week.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>From a career point of view, those are pretty good. Will I still be at Mozilla in five years? We’ll see, if the next five years are as good as the last five years.</p>
