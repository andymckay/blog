<hr class="florished">
<p>When I saw this quote:</p>
<blockquote>If this is the death of Wall Street as we know it, the tombstone will read: killed by complexity.</blockquote>
<p><cite><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.wallstreet">Guardian</a></cite></p>
<p>I thought instantly of the number of software projects that have died due to complexity. Buffetts report on the derivatives which has been widely quoted this week says:</p>
<blockquote>
Each contract has a plus or minus value derived from one or more reference items, including some of mind-boggling complexity. Valuing a portfolio like that, expert auditors could easily and honestly have widely varying opinions.</blockquote>
<p><cite><a href="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Business/pdf/2008/09/15/2002pdf.pdf">Warren Buffett</a></cite></p>
<p>It's easy to just lump anything into complexity, but it's true in software all the time. It could be that one little Rails app that's written in a mind boggling confusing way, it could be probably the biggest software project of all, Vista.</p>
<blockquote>Complexity kills.  It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and administrator frustration.</blockquote>
<p><cite><a href="http://www.devtopics.com/101-great-computer-programming-quotes/">Ray Ozzie</a></cite></p>
<p>Complexity sucks, yet through out life we've created specialisations and abstractions so that something complex like lighting a room, is as simple as turning on a light bulb.</p>
<p>My 2 cents on what I've been reading today about the end of capitalism as we know it? People's memories are short and focus on the short term. In a few years some one will have abstracted out derivatives into something simpler and people will be trading them around like before.</p>
