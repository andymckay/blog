<hr class="florished">
<p>I've been working on a product for a while, but it's not getting much traction. It's spent a lot of time in my head and taken up my time and energy. I'd planned on giving it a few months, but it's now past that schedule.</p>
<p>Every time I describe it to someone they say "that's great!". But little uptake, I looked at the numbers on the site and it's not very much and I can't keep justifying it.</p>
<p>It's hard after I've worked on something for so long to just stop working on it for a while. But there's at least one thing that keeps me hopeful that it will not die - I find it damn useful and use it all the time (and a few other people do too).</p>
<p>Perhaps I've fallen for all the 37 Signals and others advice. Work on things you find useful and enjoy and others will too. If I find it useful I'll keep working on it, improving it and telling others about it things might start to change.</p>
<p>Keep adding in things now and again, as time permits on the back burner.... but in the end time to move focus. Could be Seth Godin <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2009/06/youre-boring.html">is right</a> and the product is boring.</p>
<p>Time to do something more exciting... so watch this space.</p>
