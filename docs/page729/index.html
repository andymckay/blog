<hr class="florished">
<p>I’ve done the Whislter Gran Fondo a few times (first, second, third, fourth and fifth), but despite the misleading title, they aren’t the only Fondo’s I’ve done. Anyways, this week I completed my seventh Gran Fondo and realised I didn’t write about last years. So here goes.</p>

<p>I didn’t train enough, I was in bad shape. There was a headwind, just a horrible headwind the whole way. That’s all I can remember. I couldn’t get many drafts, you had to pedal going downhill otherwise you couldn’t get any speed.</p>

<p>Within the first hour, I knew I had no chance of beating my times, so I tried to relax. Mostly I just got stressed and tired.</p>

<p>At the end of the ride I said that’s it, I didn’t enjoy it I won’t do it again. Then my daughter signed up to do it next year. I signed up to support her.</p>

<p>Coming into this ride I’d probably done less cycling than ever.</p>

<p>It’s quite remarkable how little cycling I’ve done compared to previous years. I’ve been focusing on hiking, backpacking and bit of running throughout the summer. A prolonged period of illness (6+ weeks) at the beginning of the season and not participating in <a href="https://steedcycles.com/">Steed ride club</a> has had a big effect.</p>

<p>I’d already approached this Fondo as I ride I would take slow and easy, enjoying the ride and supporting my daughter. Then my daughter decided not to ride.</p>

<p>So I chilled and enjoyed the ride. Unlike last year, going into it with that mentality from the start, I actually did find the ride enjoyable. Fantastic views, great people.</p>

<p>Not too fussed about the time and didn’t sign up for next year. Not sure if I’ll ride it again.</p>

<p>I also needed to try and keep my body intact because next week I’ve got <a href="https://trailwhisperer.ca/frosty/">this race</a> and I’m excited and nervous about this, the way I used to be about the Whistler Fondo.</p>
