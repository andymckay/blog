<hr class="florished">
<p>Over the last week or so it became clear that we were not going to be buying a house any time soon. We did put in an offer on the house, but it was way below what they were asking. Rather it was based on what we felt the house was worth in comparison with the other houses out there. Needless to say, they said no.</p>
<p>Then we started to think about upping our offer and getting into that house. It was at that point we realised that we needed to cool off and get a rental sorted. Sit this out and let the market settle. There are 30 houses in our area, in our price range. So far since the new year, one has sold for 80k under the asking price. So what's the rush. Inventory is going up rapidly, prices are going down (<a href="http://paul-northvancouverhomes.blogspot.com/">see here for sane stats</a>).</p>
<p>So on Wednesday we got a rental sorted out. Friday we got the keys. Friday the shipment from England arrived. Saturday we got a car load of Ikea stuff. Sunday the storage arrived. Tuesday (tomorrow) we move in. Wednesday (the all important) internet will be up and running. Phew.</p>
<p>Doing this make me appreciate how hard this sort of thing would be without a support group of family and friends on either side.</p>
<p>So in a few days I might be able to get some work done. Oh and some house hunting.</p>
