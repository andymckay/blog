<p>For our wedding anniversary on Friday we went to <a href="http://www.bistro26.co.uk">Bistro 26</a> a restaurant we stumbled upon by accident in Lancaster. What an excellent find it was. We were the first there, but the place soon filled up some of whom were clear regulars.</p>
<p>I started with Crayfish and rocket salad, Danae skipped starter so she could have desert. Main course for me was chicken breast in a mustard sauce with potato and asparagus. Danae had pork wrapped in parma ham stuff with sage. It was all excellent. Desert was a raspberry brulet and hot chocolate pudding. A lot of the things on the menu were local produce found by the chef.</p>
<p>We aren't restaurant reviewers or connoisseurs, but eating out a lot in Vancouver, we've gotten used to good food. I'm so sick of expensive and terrible food eating out in England, it's not always that way, but it is still the norm. I no longer mind paying money for good food. This was excellent food, decently priced (for England) - around 50 pounds (including wine and beer). No searches for <a href="http://www.bistro26.co.uk">restaurant in Lancaster</a> turned them up, so here goes.</p>
