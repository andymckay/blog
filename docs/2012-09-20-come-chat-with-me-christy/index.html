<blockquote>"I think politicians do a way better job when we are out there talking to the people"</blockquote>

<p>So come speak to me Christy. You can come meet me at work or knock on my door. Either of those would work.</p>

<p>Alright so there are 4.4 million people in BC, you can't visit everyone. But let's say you stopped by my work for an hour. That's 20 people, that's a more efficient use of your time. [<a href="https://mckay.pub.ca/blog/andy/2349/#numbers">1</a>]</p>

<p>You aren't planning on going to the legislature and speaking to MP's or going to Victoria because:</p>

<blockquote>Because it's sick. It's a sick culture</blockquote>

<p>You've got 6 months, plenty of time.</p>

<p>Or perhaps you could use reddit. Some guy called <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/">Obama</a> did that bet that would cross a few people off the list. [<a href="https://mckay.pub.ca/blog/andy/2349/#wowbagger">2</a>]</p>

<p>If you'd like Christy to come talk to you, you could contact her on <a href="https://twitter.com/christyclarkbc">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Add this link to your site and see if you can encourage <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=.@christyclarkbc come chat with me! https://mckay.pub.ca/blog/andy/2349/">Christy to come chat with you</a>:</p>
<pre>
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/home/?status=.@christyclark come chat with me!"&gt;Come chat with me Christy&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p>&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>[<a name="numbers">1</a>] I know the numbers don't add up. There's 4.4 million people in BC. Seeing 20 people for an hour, eight hours day for say twenty days a month would take somewhere in the order of 76 years. That's probably why we have elected officials to talk on our behalf.</p>

<p>[<a name="wowbagger">2</a>] I couldn't help but think of <a href="http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Wowbagger">Bowerick Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged</a>.</p>
