<p>ðŸ‘‹ In September 2025 I completely rewrote and refocused this blog onto hiking. That's the main thing I want to talk about.</p>
<p>Since I started this in 2006, when Twitter had only just started, there's lots of old, irrelevant and out of data content here.</p>
<p>I've set up redirects to GitHub for content that I know exists there. As for the rest, oh well. Embrace the imperanance.
