title: About this blog
---

This is a blog about hiking and the outdoors in general. I'm based in North Vancouver, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I love spending time outside, hiking and backpacking, in BC and around the world. I don't do enough, but I do enjoy being outside.

### 2025 Blog update

I've had this blog since 2006 and what interests me in 2025 is quite different. Since I spend a lot of time hiking, running, back packing and generally being outdoors far away from computers this website got updated. Old content is still <a href="https://github.com/andymckay/blog">available on GitHub</a> and there should be a 404 page that redirects you over there in case you want to read any of it.

### The US

Being a proud Canadian, I won't be travelling to the US anytime soon for any hikes. Any hikes on this site in the US are from before the current 2025 administration. I will also avoiding buying anything from the US. It sometimes happens, but I'll avoid it if I can. I will note any gear that is from the US.
