Well, our next visit "back home" is fast approaching. We will be in town for 3 weeks surrounding Kelly's wedding. Will probably do a number of family visits but should have lots of time for visits with friends as well. Am thinking about having a meal out with anyone who can make it sometime during the 3 weeks, but not sure of details yet. Anyone know of a restaurant like Kelsey's that is children-friendly, can take a large group but won't care if only half your number turn up, but serves decent food? (Can you tell we're not that keen on Kelsey's?)<br/><br/>

Other planned activities include the carousel at Burnaby Village Museum, Maplewood Farm, and most likely a trip to the Karen Magnussen Wave Pool. Let me know if you'd like to join us for any of these - no specific dates yet, so tell me what works for you! And if you have any great ideas for other things to do with the kids (or without them, providing Grandma and Grandpa will babysit for a few hours), I'd love to hear them!
