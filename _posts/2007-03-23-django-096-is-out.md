<p>Django 0.96 is out. Get those shiny new features you know you want including the things I wanted: newforms, tests and fixtures.</p>
<blockquote>
Django now ships with a comprehensive set of testing tools. You can write tests based on doctest or unittest, test your views with a simple test harness, and load initial data ("fixtures") automatically.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Django 0.96 also ships with a brand new forms library, django.newforms. This is a replacement for django.forms, the old forms/manipulator/validation framework</blockquote>
