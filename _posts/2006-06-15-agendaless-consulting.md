Paul, Tres and Chris formed <a href="http://www.agendaless.com/">Agendaless Consulting</a>:

<blockquote>We are specialists in building large, custom web applications using a collection of technologies, centered around Zope and Plone.</blockquote>

Good luck to the three of you. I know with the talent, skills and abilities of those three that Agendaless will be a premier consulting company.
