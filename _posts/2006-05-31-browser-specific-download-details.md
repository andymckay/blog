Just noticed that if you download Skype, you get specific instructions for your browser, with little screenshots. You can see this <a href="http://www.skype.com/download/skype/windows/downloading.html">here</a>. That's a simple idea that's probably been used elsewhere, but that's a great for making the software easier to download and use.
