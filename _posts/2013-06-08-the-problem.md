When the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/07/prism-tech-giants-shock-nsa-data-mining">PRISM scandal broke</a>,
all the major tech companies were <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/06/what.html">quick to deny it</a>.

But look at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order">Verizon sharing</a>
court order. The court order states:

<blockquote>IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that no person shall disclose to any other person that
the FBI or NSA has sought or obtained tangible things under this Order, other than to:
(a) those persons to whom disclosure is necessary to comply with such Order; (b)
an attorney to obtain legal advice or assistance with respect to the production of things
in response to the Order; or (c) other persons as permitted by the Director of the FBI
or the Director's designee.</blockquote>

So if Google, Microsoft and so on were under a similar order, they would have to deny it as well. So we can't believe them.

<blockquote>People briefed on the discussions spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are prohibited by law from discussing the content of FISA requests or even acknowledging their existence. </blockquote>

So whats the answer? Don't work with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/mps-call-for-government-to-consider-ending-use-of-cloud-amid-concerns-that-us-authorities-can-access-information-8473693.html">US companies</a> or store data on <a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2013/may/cloud-provider-to-build-uk-data-centre-after-admitting-data-security-concerns-have-hindered-bids-for-government-contracts/">US servers</a> for sensitive things. Like say <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/07/17/bc-maximus.html">medical records</a>. Oh wait.

This is something I remembered bringing up a long time ago with people. I would much, much, much rather use a <a href="http://www.cacloud.com/">Canadian hosting company</a> than a US one.
