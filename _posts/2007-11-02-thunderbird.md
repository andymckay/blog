<p>With all the news about <a href="http://ascher.ca/blog/">David Ascher</a> and Thunderbird, I switched back to Thunderbird the other day. But a day of it and I switched back to OS X's Mail.app. In essence there was nothing that it gave me over Mail.app, or nothing I could spot.</p>
<ul>
<li>After being used to the Mac I found the large number of preference screens all over the place confusing, took me a while to find anything. I remember neons ago Thunderbird was far more polished than Outlook Express. Now it feels out of date.</li>
<li>Most of the extensions weren't that useful, extensions are Thunderbird's weapon and they were hard to do much useful.</li>
<li>I got a large number of spinning Mac discs of hell, due to I believe SSL incompatabilities with my server. I did later find an extension to solve this, that didn't work.</li>
<li>The RSS feed was nice and I do like that reader, but realised that I like reading that in a browser anyway. </li>
<li>The LDAP lookup of my address book did work well and was nice. But Mail.app does that and feels more polished to me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saying all this, Thunderbird is still the best non-Mac client there is and I look forward to what the new changes will bring. Except maybe for gmail. Or mutt.</p>
