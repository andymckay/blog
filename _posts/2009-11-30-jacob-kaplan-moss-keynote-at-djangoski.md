<p>We are excited to announce that Jacob Kaplan-Moss will be giving one of the keynote talks at <a href="http://clearwind.ca/djangoski">DjangoSki</a>.</p>
<p>It's almost impossible to be around Django and not know who <a href="http://jacobian.org/">Jacob</a> is. He's one of the original <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/committers/#internals-committers">founders of Django</a>, is on the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/">foundation board</a>, is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_For_Life">co-BDFL of Django</a> and is the co-author of <a href="http://apress.com/book/view/143021936x">The Definitive Guide to Django</a>. Let's face it, if it's got something to do with Django, Jacob has had some influence on it. Currently Jacob works at <a href="http://www.revsys.com/">Revolution Systems</a> where he gets to do lots more Django.</p>
<p>After missing Jacob at DjangoCon in Portland, it will be certainly good to have him around in Whistler. Perhaps even get some sprinting on Django 1.2 (which will be out a few days after DjangoSki). Jacob writes a <a href="http://jacobian.org/">great blog</a> and is a great speaker.</p>
