<p>There was a post on the <a href="http://ru.worsethanfailure.com/Articles/For-Your-Security.aspx">Daily WTF</a> about the license for WordWeb. The license was seen as joke, it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
You may use the program free of charge indefinitely only if
<ul>
<li>You take at most 4 flights (2 return flights) in any 12 month period</li>
<li>AND you do not own or regularly drive an SUV (sports utility vehicle).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The goal of this license is too reduce emissions. A laudable goal but certainly a strange thing to see. And taking random shots at flights and SUV's isn't likely to help except in getting you posted on Daily WTF. </p><p>But what if <b>there was a license</b> that tried to enforce some kind of green requirement on users. Of course it would be almost impossible to enforce, regulate and look after, almost like 90% of the open source licenses out there already in fact.</p>
<p>But then you'd need to have some way of measuring how green a person or organisation is. Maybe a little more <a href="http://www.reducereuserecycle.co.uk/greengames/how_green_are_you_fun_quiz.php">complex than this</a>. Could it be possible to make software that forces people to change habits? That would really be a wonderful goal.</p>
