<p>One of the many things I'm looking forward to in heading back to Canada around Christmas is that the iPhone should be out in Canada by then. I resisted here because I wasn't going to be around long enough and somehow unlocking and losing some features doesn't appeal.</p>
<p>Then I heard it will be 3G and now GPS? Excellent, 7 months to go and counting. Hopefully Rogers won't cripple me with bills though. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2008/04/29/tech-iphone.html?ref=rss">Source</a>.</p>
