At home I now run only two operating systems Ubuntu for everything that's not a Mac and OS X for everything that is. Was getting way too hard to keep track of all the things running and their quirks. I've just installed Ubuntu on a couple of old laptops to use as servers and its a breeze. Took me two minutes to realise the CD server install did not install a gui and then I have to:

<pre>apt-get install ubuntu-desktop</pre>

So far going well.

<strong>Update</strong>: installed 3 towers of varying hardware and 2 laptop's and Ubuntu worked with only one hitch (hard drive size settings) in all cases.
