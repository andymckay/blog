I've started collecting in SVN recipes that I use in Clouseau. Thanks to the load from URL feature of Clouseau, we can now start to re-use recipes for each other. If you've got something useful, then click save and mail the saved recipe to me and after a quick review we'll add it in. Yeah should probably start some sort of content management system thing for these one day.

Anyway they are at: <a href="http://svn.clearwind.ca/public/plone/recipes">http://svn.clearwind.ca/public/plone/recipes</a>
