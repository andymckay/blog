January 16th<br /><br />I keep hearing (mostly from my mother) about the storms in Vancouver and all the wind damage. So many trees have been knocked down in recent storms! I remember thinking the hillsides on &quot;the Cut&quot; had been decimated by wind storms before we left Canada, and couldn&#39;t believe when they had to close the Lion&#39;s Gate Bridge because of fallen trees on the Stanley Park Causeway. Now there have been more storms and tonnes more trees blown over in Stanley Park.<br /><br />It&#39;s funny, I think we&#39;ve had wind storms that were just as strong since we&#39;ve been here, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be the sort of damage that Vancouver has been getting. Andy says it&#39;s because the UK gets so many big windstorms that the trees have adapted - and those that haven&#39;t got blown down a long time ago! Makes some sense, I guess. We certainly seem to have a LOT of windy days!
