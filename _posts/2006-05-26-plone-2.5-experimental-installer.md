title: Plone 2.5 experimental installer
---
Sidnei has been working on an <a href="http://awkly.org/">experimental installer of 2.5</a>, please go and download it and give him all the feedback you can. Any help appreciated.

In unrelated news, two reasonably hard core Plone and Zope users switch their blogs to Wordpress in the same week. What's with that?
