<p>This is one of my all-time favourite photos that I've taken. I took it in my back garden just a few months before we sold the house and moved to England. I just love that the depth of focus is limited by the fact of being taken so close-up, so that the second flower is slightly out of focus. And the colours of this particular variety of Dahlia are fabulous. I'm glad to say that we dug up the bulbs and they have been replanted in my sister's garden so I will be able to see these gorgeous flowers again.</p>
