The Liberal government made deficits illegal in 2001:

<blockquote>"The main estimates for a fiscal year must not contain a forecast of a deficit for that fiscal year."</blockquote>

Feb. 2 2009, that legislation was amended to allow them.

On the campaign trail:

<blockquote>Clark has reiterated during her campaign her pledge to use the revenues from LNG to establish a Prosperity Fund to pay down the provincial debt in 15 years.</blockquote>

Amount of revenues from LNG sources so far? Zero.

Yeah, right.
