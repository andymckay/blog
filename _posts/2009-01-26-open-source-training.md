<p>One of the mis-conceptions with open source is that there's a lack of training. That's not true, it's just that there's a lot of training spread out all over the place through different vendors. There are a couple of sites that do list the training, but there a few things I want from them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to rate the training so that other's can see the how good it is.</li>
<li>Similarly give comments on the training.</li>
<li>Get all the training in my calendar (which means iCal) and RSS.</li>
<li>An API for accessing the training would be nice.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds like it's a pretty straightforward Django site. So a few days later I'm announcing <a href="http://www.cleartrain.ca">Cleartrain</a>, a site to index training on open source projects. We've indexed quite a lot of the trainings we've been able to find. At first, we are specifically focusing on our favourites <a href="http://www.cleartrain.ca/list/topics/2/">Plone</a>, <a href="http://www.cleartrain.ca/list/topics/4/">Django</a> and <a href="http://www.cleartrain.ca/list/topics/1/">Python</a>. The latter two seem quite under represented, probably need to keep digging.</p>
<p>The site is using Django and jQuery and Page Templates. The Javascript is done using jQuery (despite earlier posts) and go done quite quickly, I do like the clicking on an item filters it in the list, i'd like to add in the reverse as well.</p>
<p>We'll keep adding into this site as we see training, but if you have training you'd like to add in, please <a href="http://www.cleartrain.ca/add/">add it in here</a>.</p>
