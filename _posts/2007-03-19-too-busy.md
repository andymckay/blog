Life's too busy right now to write any interesting posts... was going to write more about our trip to Cambridge and London last weekend, and about our visit to Beatrix Potter's house and gallery in the Lake Disrict this Saturday, but with our trip to Vancouver looming, I'm just too busy with packing and everything! So it will have to wait a bit. Hopefully I'll have time to write a few posts while in Canada. So keep watching this space!
