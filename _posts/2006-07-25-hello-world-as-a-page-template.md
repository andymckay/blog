I&#39;ve been asked this at least three times on IRC in that last few days. I think this didn&#39;t get covered in my book, so here goes.  If there was a standard Hello World page template, it would look like this: <div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">post snipped because tinymce is moronic!</span></div>
