<p>Sorry just to have call this one as I see it. The Ajaxian blog is cool, I read it and like it. But have you ever tried to post a comment there? Here's an abbreviated version of the form. That's right, my phone number and post code etc to leave a comment. OpenID would be perfect but something simple would be better, please sign your name at <a href="http://demand.openid.net/site/ajaxian.com">Demand OpenID</a>.</p>
