<p>This does look nice and has got lots of good bits, but there's one thing I love about my Mac Mini's (well apart from the obvious OS X instead of Vista)... it has no fan. To be something I'd put in my living room, I want no white noise. The press release says nothing about this so we'll assume it does. Oh well.</p>
