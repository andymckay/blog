<p>I love the headline on a recent press release:</p>
<blockquote>ThoughtWorks Studios releases new Ruby-in-enterprise effort</blockquote>
<cite><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.ca/press-releases/ThoughtWorks-Studios-releases-RubyWorks.html">Thoughtworks</a></cite>
<p>To me that sounds like:</p>
<blockquote>well we worked on it for a few weekends, its something, a good effort...</blockquote>
<p>Which as my colleague Ian put it:</p>
<blockquote>good effort is what appears on school reports when the pupil has worked hard but is fundamentally thick</blockquote>
<p>Come on guys, work on those press releases.</p>
