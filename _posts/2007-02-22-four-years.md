<p>Tommorrow I'll be working on an application that I helped write about <b>four</b> years ago. It's sat at a clients site and run constantly for four years. Then the hard drive gave out. Since then Iraq got invaded, I had a family and I moved continents.</p>

<p>I don't think I've written anything that has sat and worked consistently and well for that long. I was chatting to my friend Ian Cottee about this and for a while I got quite sentimental about this. It's a testament to Python and Linux and bright sparks like Ian Cottee who can put this sort of thing together.</p>

<p>I'll have a toast with a glass of scotch for that little application.</p>
