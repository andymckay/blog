<p>One thing that's holding me back from using Google Apps is that they are generally damn ugly. You can use Mail.app to pull mail in Gmail down and get a nicer UI. I can pull my calendar down into iCal and get a nice UI as well. But in the end those web UI's 
are full of far too many buttons and links and just don't thrill me.</p>
<p>I've been using Fluid for my Google Reader and it rocks. I can now just hit RSS in Quicksilver and get my RSS feeds. Using the scripts from <a href="http://userscripts.org">userscripts.org</a> I now get: Growl notifications of new posts and a count in the dock of new posts. Today I grabbed this script: <a href="http://flingmedia.com/articles/making-google-reader-for-fluid/">http://flingmedia.com/articles/making-google-reader-for-fluid/</a> and that applies a custom stylesheet. It makes the reader look like the screenshot below. Weeee!</p>
