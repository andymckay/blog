<p>That's the subject of this <a href="http://www.gifttool.com/registrar/ShowEventDetails?ID=1339&EID=7135">TechForum talk</a>.</p>
<p>Now I can pretty much assume that I'm not the target audience here. But as someone who considers himself reasonably with it in the Vancouver tech crowd, I can pretty much answer "No the Vancouver Tech Community is not broken".</p>
<p>There's a whole pile of tech communities that meet and discuss things. Python, Javascript, Django, iPhone, PhoneGap: these are the one's I attend (or try to). There's also a large Drupal and PHP community here. We run conferences like <a href="http://clearwind.ca/djangoski">DjangoSki</a>, <a href="http://www.openwebvancouver.ca/">Open Web Vancouver</a>, or <a href="http://2010.northernvoice.ca/">Northern Voice</a>.</p>
<p>...and what's the common connection of all these meetings? <b>Open source software</b>. If you are doing development using open source software, you join or build communities, it's part of it's success. Big business (generally) does not do this, to their detriment.</p>
<p>Having a quick look at the <a href="http://www.bctia.org/files/BIOS/Bio_TechForum_-_June_17_(updated2).pdf">biographies</a> and the companies involved, I doubt much of this will be mentioned.</p>
<p>The TechForum talk costs $49.50 to attend, so I won't be going. But if you are, be interested to hear the conclusion.</p>
