The <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tfsa/">TFSA</a> is a savings account for Canadians that was introduced in 2009.

As a quick check I wanted to see how much or little my TFSA had changed against what it should be. That meant a double check of how much room I had in the TFSA each year. So this is a quick cacluation the theoretical case: that you are able to invest the maximum amount each year, at the beginning of the year and get <b>5% return</b> (after fees) on that.

|Year  |Maximum     |Total Inv.  |Compounded  |
|------|------------|------------|------------|
| 2009 | $5,000.00  | $5,000.00  | $5,250.00  |
| 2010 | $5,000.00  | $10,000.00 | $10,762.50 |
| 2011 | $5,000.00  | $15,000.00 | $16,550.63 |
| 2012 | $5,000.00  | $20,000.00 | $22,628.16 |
| 2013 | $5,500.00  | $25,500.00 | $29,534.56 |
| 2014 | $5,500.00  | $31,000.00 | $36,786.29 |
| 2015 | $10,000.00 | $41,000.00 | $49,125.61 |
| 2016 | $5,500.00  | $46,500.00 | $57,356.89 |

Which always raises the question for me of what is a reasonable rate to calculate at these days. It always used to be 10%, but that's very hard to get these days. Since 2006 the annualized return on the S&P 500 is 5.158% for example.

Perhaps 5% represents too conversative a number.
