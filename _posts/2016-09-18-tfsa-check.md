The <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tfsa/">TFSA</a> is a savings account for Canadians that was introduced in 2009.

As a quick check I wanted to see how much or little my TFSA had changed against what it should be. That meant a double check of how much room I had in the TFSA each year. So this is a quick cacluation the theoretical case: that you are able to invest the maximum amount each year, at the beginning of the year and get <b>5% return</b> (after fees) on that.

Which always raises the question for me of what is a reasonable rate to calculate at these days. It always used to be 10%, but that's very hard to get these days. Since 2006 the annualized return on the S&P 500 is 5.158% for example. Perhaps 5% represents too conversative a number.

**Update**: added in 2017 and 2018 numbers.
