<p>Had a nice weekend here in Vancouver. Went skiing up Grouse, walked the dog twice and spent Sunday afternoon on the beach. I'm absolutely delighted to think that I've got 3 beaches in walking distance of my new house, the furthest is about 10 mins walk away through a park. Ah that's Vancouver for you.</p>
<p>I also posted to the plone-users list asking if any Vancouverites were interested in re-forming a Plone Vancouver User Group. The response has so far been zero, so here's hoping it got lost in the traffic and there is still some one out there doing Plone in Vancouver.</p>
