<p>Added some posts to <a href="http://www.djangozen.com">djangozen.com</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://djangozen.com/blog/signal-vs-overriding-save">Signals vs overriding save</a></li>
<li><a href="http://djangozen.com/blog/content-mirror-and-this-site">Content mirror and djangozen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I added in tagging for plugins (the tag cloud doesn't change the fonts because I hate that) and allowed anyone to own and unowned project. I also added in notifications to twitter, follow along at <a href="http://twitter.com/djangozen">http://twitter.com/djangozen</a>.</p>
<p>And finally I pulled out the plango source which powers a lot of the site and put the source online: <a href="http://djangozen.com/plugins/view/plango/">http://djangozen.com/plugins/view/plango/</a>.</p>
<p>Next the job board, oh and a bit of traffic would help.</p>
