<p>One nice thing about Google Web Apps, is that you can automatically log in with a Google account. That is if you live in the US. Otherwise it <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2">doesn't work</a>.  Well that saves me from working on it tonight. Look forward to seeing that bug fixed.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> appears to be fixed, that was fast.  Hopefully they won't <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/08/google-to-close-huddlechat/">take down my app</a> when I write it though.</p>
