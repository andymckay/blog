<p>Lots of talk this week about how the Aussies are banning the old ordinary light bulb. An interesting idea and definitely one that every country should take up. But CBC has an interesting point:</p>
<blockquote>
There is also what you might call the beer-fridge problem. Years ago, Ontario Hydro offered huge rebates if its customers would switch to the latest energy-efficient fridges (and other appliances). Many people took them up on the offer, then just put the old fridge down in the basement and used it as a second appliance, a beer fridge, in the process adding to energy demand.

<p>The sad fact is that banning light bulbs is a good move and should be done. But it will only slow down slightly the increases.</p>
