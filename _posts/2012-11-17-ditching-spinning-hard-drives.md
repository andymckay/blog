<p>I know I came late to the party, but this week I finally ditched all my laptops with spinning hard drives. Well ditched as in not use them very much, they sit in the corner.</p>
<p>I've now been at Mozilla for over two years (and that could be another blog post) and that meant I was due for a new laptop. So for the last few months I've been eyeing up the retina 15" MacBook Pro for that new laptop and avoiding the cycling issue.</p>
<p>I cycle to and from the Mozilla office lugging an old really heavy 15" MacBook. It was too heavy to carry on my back and it overbalanced my bike when in a pannier. Cycling to and from work carrying that was a pain and it actually broke my pannier. The zip weakened and broke and it nearly fell onto the road.</p>
<p>So I gave in and got a 11" MacBook Air, partly because so many people had told what a great machine it is. And it is. Perfect for plugging into my workstation keyboards and monitors. Easy to cycle with and work on any time and powerful enough for all my stuff. Within a few days I switched from the old MacBook and never used it again.</p>
<p>Then I got the new 15" Retina MacBook and it's gorgeous. Fast, powerful, well made and a beautiful display. In a few short weeks I've got rid of spinning hard drives, CD's and gone for nice new laptops with SSDs.</p>
<p>I don't think I can ever go back, the difference is so big. Everything everyone said it would be for years.</p>
