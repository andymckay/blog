<p>Over at Blue Fountain we are looking for some <a href="http://www.bluefountain.com/about/recruitment-information">web application developers</a>. If you know of anyone who might be interested, get them to drop me a line.</p><p>On that subject I did a search for some job boards like attract a higher market than the avg. Monster or otherwise job site eg: Joel on Software, 37 Signals or TechCrunch only to find them full of US jobs and people. Anyone know a UK or Europe equivalent.</p>
