<p>There's a great blog going on here "<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/monthwithoutplastic/">Month without plastic</a>". Which is not as simple as it seems. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/monthwithoutplastic/2008/08/11/">For example</a>, tried brushing your teeth without a plastic toothbrush and where do you get toothpaste?</p>
<p>Curiously enough on the 3rd she went to the Garstang show, just down the road.</p>
<p>On a related note the <a href="http://plone.org/events/conferences/2009-call-for-proposals/">Plone 2009 conference</a> call for bids went online today and includes this wonderful point:</p>
<blockquote>
Conferences consume a great deal of energy and generate a lot of waste; we encourage you to consider how you can "green" your conference by: providing recycling; avoiding disposables; using recycled materials; minimizing or eliminating paper handouts; avoiding low-quality mass-produced "swag"; serving locally-produced, organic food, etc. </blockquote>
<p>The only thing I disliked about the wonderfully run 2007 conference, was turning up and getting crap like mouse mats. If it was me (and its not) I wouldn't even give people an agenda, never mind printing out people's slides onto paper. Go Plone for a greener conference.</p>
