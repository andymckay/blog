<p>Thanks to sponsorship from the Python Software Foundation we've got some <b>free</b> tickets to give away to people from charities or non-profits.</p>
<p>Do you know someone who uses Django in a charity? Or are you at a charity? Do you use Django or want to learn about it? Like skiing, snowboarding or just hanging out in Whistler? Then nominate someone, or yourself. We've got a limited number of tickets and time is short - so hop to it.</p>
<p><del>Fill out the form here</del >.</p>
<p><i>Note: the image isn't relevant, but was one of the first hits on Flickr for ticket. It's much colder in Whistler.</i></p>

<p><b>Update:</b> people chosen and contacted.</p>
