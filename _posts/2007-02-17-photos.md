Would you believe my mother-in-law found out his name before I did??!! Dad didn't tell me when he phoned with the news. I knew it was to be Julian and some combination of grandfathers' names, but didn't know the final choice. Anyway, turns out my niece Rachael phoned up her granny before going to school and told her of her new cousin Julian James Thomas Nobles, so I only heard from Granny what his full name was to be. Hmph! <br/><br/>Jordan has since sent an email with more info (which I've corrected in my previous post) and, more importantly, some photos.<br/><br/><a href="/files/first-look.jpg">Kelly & Julian</a><br/><a href="/files/julian.jpg">Julian</a><br/><a href="/files/j-and-j.jpg">Proud Daddy</a>
