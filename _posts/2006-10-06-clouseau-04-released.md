Featuring improved tooltips if you have DocFinderTab, improved UI features, retrieve as text and a few other features and fixes. The photo shows the improved tool tip (to answer my earlier post). I wonder if Clouseau is the first Plone product that includes instructions in the help file on how to delete your Plone site?

<blockquote>
Q: Can I delete my plone site with this?
A: Sure try: app.manage_delObjects(["Plone",]); utils.commit(). Woohoo.

<b>Upgrades:</b> do an install and uninstall from the add/remove products section of the Plone control panel to the new icons and fixed virtual hosting for context prompts.
