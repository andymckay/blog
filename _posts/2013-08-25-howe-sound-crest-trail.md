One of my ambitions for many years has to been to hike the Howe Sound Crest
Trail to the Lions. A couple of weeks ago we got that opportunity. As it turned out
it was not the sunniest morning but it made for a fabulous hike.

Here's some pictures.

This also gave me chance to play with the new wide angle lens for Danaes Canon.

Stunning hike out of Vancouver. Hope to do it again, but get further and be in less pain after.
