<p>I do try to remember to post on places we've been that were good. Before our trip to Egypt we went to Llandudno for the weekend. It was a nice weekend, but being in November was a little cold, windy and well closed.</p>
<p>We did find a <a href="http://www.mayfairguesthouse.com/">great bed and breakfast</a>, they took really good care of us and the kids. That evening we went to the <a href="http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/15/15578/Albert/Llandudno">Albert Pub</a> which has been renovated and is serving great food. The waiters were quite flustered by our request to take our desert out, and packed up a huge pile of ice cream and cheesecake for us. It then proceeded to leak all over the table in the hotel so we just had to eat it all.</p>
<p>One thing that we enjoyed seeing were the seagulls, grabbing muscles from the sea shore. They'd fly up a metre or three then drop them on the pavement. Repeating this until the muscles cracked open and could eat the insides. And it made some for interesting photos.</p>
