<h2>pluzzy</h2>
<ul style="padding-left: 2em">
<li>The warm fuzzy feeling you get on navigating to a web site, only to find unexpectedly that it is in fact built in Plone. The opposite of ploop.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ploop</h2>
<ul style="padding-left: 2em">
<li>Normally felt after encountering pluzzy. The slight let down felt, when you realize that the site in question is not in fact Plone. Usually felt when you realise the web site is in fact using Drupal, Typo 3 or something else PHP.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
