<p>The Vancouver Python Meetup  went well a couple of weeks ago. This did conflict with a Canucks game, but I was very delighted to see over a dozen people turn up to the meeting. We haven't had that many in quite a while.</p>

<p>We talked about a wide <a href="http://typewith.me/thZ6GnNuyM">variety of topics</a>. My favourite was the demonstration from Tavis demonstration on how he controls his development environment using speech. It's awesome to watch the setup as he talks to combination of Dragon Speech running in a Windows VM controlling Emacs on a Mac... with lots of magic inbetween (and even some Python).</p>

<p>Thanks to Mozilla for providing space, beer and (cold) pizza.</p>

<p>The next talk is set for: Wednesday June 15th, 2011 at 7pm.</p>

<p><b>However:</b> this conflicts with game 7. So if the Stanley Cup goes to game 7 we'll postpone the meetup till the next day or so. Depending on how good or bad the party is.</p>
