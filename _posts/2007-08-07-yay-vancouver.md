<p>Over at Montreal Tech Watch there's an article on <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MontrealTechWatch/~3/141589588/">Vancouver: Canadas Greatest Start-Up City?</a>. I've been a huge Vancouver fan for many years, there's so much potential there. All the companies mentioned I know and makes me feel sad I'm not there. It's a prime location for pulling in talent, the lifestyle there is way better than say San Jose.</p>
<p>I'll keep saying it to Google people, open an office in Vancouver to suck in all the talent who can't get US visas. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2007/07/05/microsoft-vancouver.html">Microsoft have just done it</a>.</p>
<p>The one ommision of this article is probably the greatest Web 2.0 success, Flickr</p>
