So I&#39;ve got this neat Django app that pulls together photo&#39;s linked in with locations on a google map. I want to scroll through those photos using a nice little Ajax or Flash app that does all those nice things like cross fading and browsing. There&#39;s loads out there, but they&#39;ve all got server requirements like php. I haven&#39;t found anything that takes a xhtml page, parses the DOM and produces the photo viewer from that.<div><br /></div><div>At least I haven&#39;t found one, I must be blind. Anyone got any recommendations?</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Update:</span> the excellent Scott Schiller seems to have a nice app here<a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/35mm/" target="_blank">http://www.schillmania.com/projects/35mm/</a> but I&#39;m not sure I like the interface I found it confusing, I&#39;m sure my mother would. Seems to herald from Vancouver so gets lots of bonus points for that. But looks damn good, might be the fella.</span></div>
