<p>I am very excited to announce the <a href="http://clearwind.ca/djangoski/">DjangoSki Conference</a> in Whistler, March 2nd-4th 2010.</p>
<p>This is a conference that combines my favourite web application framework with one of my favourite sports, skiing. If you are going to run a conference, may as well do it somewhere with style right? The conference is slightly unusual in that it's styled a bit after an unconference. There are several keynote talks we are lining up and some introductory talks, but the rest of the conference is up to the attendees.</p>
<p>Each day will have sprints or ad-hoc talks created by the attendees. The real goal is to focus on the things I find enjoyable about a conference - meeting people and learning. Sprints are the ideal way to learn from other people. I'm not <a href="http://ericholscher.com/blog/2009/nov/16/you-should-stay-sprints/">alone in this</a>.</p>
<p>Details will follow as we get registration and keynotes organized.</p>
<p>So if you are planning a ski holiday this year and do Django, the choice has just become a whole lot easier. Come to Whistler and have a damn good time.</p>
