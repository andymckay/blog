Stopped by the <a href="http://www.straight.com/content.cfm?id=19838">Vancouver Public Library</a> today for a friends concert. Friend of the family Jordan Noble is an organiser and one of the composers of the Vertical Orchestra. A series of peices played in the libraries atrium where the drum section plays in the moat and the brass on the 4th story. 

I'm not a expert on these things, but I do know it was a very cool and interesting sound and worth listening too. The kids loved it, Samantha at 4 months was kicking her legs like crazy every time the drums kicked in.
