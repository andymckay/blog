Moved all the services off my venerable old Pentium 1, 166 thing that is held together by duct tape (literally) over to a dedicated server. So hopefully the site and services will be nice and fast now, too.

Since I used Ubuntu I quickly upgraded Wordpress as well to version 2.0 which gives me access to many nice themes for the blog.
