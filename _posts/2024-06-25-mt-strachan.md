Bagged: ✅ Mount Strachan
<p>ℹ️ <a href="/files/peaks-bagged.html">List of 2024 peaks bagged</a>.</p>

<hr class="florished">

Saturday we headed up Mount Strachan. This is a pretty easy hike, but again at about 1,100m elevation we hit snow and ice. We were able to keep going, but it was inconsistent snow and bare rock - making spikes hard to use on my feet.

In the end we just gave up and hiked the ski runs up and down, boring but got the job done.

We got to the peak, but the true peak (10m higher) was looking rather scary, with very steep up and downs on invisible trails across treacherous snow. At this point, like everyone else we encountered that day, we decided not to go for the other peak and turn back from the true peak.

It's one of those weekends where I had grand plans of more peaks and they didn't happen.

Damn.
