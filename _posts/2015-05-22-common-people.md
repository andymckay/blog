<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_People_%28song%29">Twenty years ago (May 22nd 1995)</a>, Pulp released the single "Common People":

Unfortunately, that version is censored. At 2 mins 30 seconds the lyrics are:

<blockquote>
You'll never watch your life slide out of view,<br/>
and dance and drink and screw<br/>
Because there's nothing else to do.<br/>
</blockquote>

The version on youtube omits "and screw". This song has some great lyrics:

<blockquote>
Smoke some fags and play some pool, pretend you never went to school.<br/>
But still you'll never get it right<br/>
'cos when you're laid in bed at night watching roaches climb the wall<br/>
If you call your Dad he could stop it all.<br/>
</blockquote>

This was a defining song of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop">Britpop</a>
era and I can remember it clearly being part of an Oasis (Manchester) vs Pulp (London) rivalry.

Of course, you haven't made it until William Shatner covers it:

Of that Jarvis said:

<blockquote>
In 2011 Jarvis Cocker praised the cover version: "I was very flattered by that because I was a massive Star Trek fan as a kid and so you know, Captain Kirk is singing my song! So that was amazing."
</blockquote>

Apparently the subject of song is a lady who might have been named Danae, my wife's name.

There is a documentary about Pulp I haven't seen:

I'm now going to go listen to every Pulp song ever.
