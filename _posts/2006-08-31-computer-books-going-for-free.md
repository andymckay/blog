Here's a list of the computer books that I've collected over the years. Of varying quality publishers (O'Reilly and Apress on down) and some annotated (from courses). But all going for free or donation, you just have to come to North Vancouver to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1425+chamberlain+drive,+north+vancouver,+bc&om=1">my house</a> to get them. Please <a href="mailto:andy@clearwind.ca">email</a> beforehand to check we'll be there.
