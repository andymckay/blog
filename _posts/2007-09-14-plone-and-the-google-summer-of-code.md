<p><a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/">Read/Write Web</a>, a excellent blog I follow had a post which excited me "<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/silverstripe_open_source_cms_google_summer_of_code.php">SilverStripe - Open Source CMS Has Support From Google</a>". For a moment I thought wow, that's unusual for Google to support a CMS, whats going on until I found out it meant:</p>
<blockquote>Another interesting thing about SilverStripe is that it recently got support from Google, in the form of being a part of the Google Summer of Code project</blockquote>
<p>Oh is that it? Bear in mind that Plone has participated in the the Summer of Code for at least 2 years and has had quite a few contributions. So has Django. In fact the list is <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/">quite long</a> and among the CMS's in there includes: Plone, SilverStripe, Joomla, Drupal and probably a whole bunch of other one's I've never heard of.</p>
<p>So calm down everyone, nothing much has changed. If you want to talk about CMS's take a look at Plone which in maturity is far beyond most of the other CMS's you've seen in the comments.</p>
