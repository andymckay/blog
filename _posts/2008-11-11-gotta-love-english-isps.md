<p>Cost of cancelling our broadband:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 pounds cancellation fee (which they just added a month ago)</li>
<li>14.99 pounds hook up fee which is waived after 12 months, we haven't quite been with them for 12 months</li>
<li>19.99 pounds for last months service</li>
</ul>
<p>So ~55 pounds. Thank you <a href="http://plus.net">plus.net</a>, <a href="http://virgin.net">Virgin</a> was terrible too. Golly as much as Rogers suck, I didn't realise how good they were in comparison. All ISP's and Telco's suck, it's one of those universal rules. Some just suck more than others.</p>
