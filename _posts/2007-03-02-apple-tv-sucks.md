<p>I haven't used it. Or seen it. But I have seen <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/appletv/tour.html">this page</a> and I'm now convinced it sucks. The first thing it offers is <i>Movie Trailers</i>. Movie trailers are adverts, people pay to put movie trailers in front of us. It's annoying enough having them on DVD's you have to fight your way past.</p>
<p>If you think I'm paying to buy a box so I can watch adverts think again. Having movie trailers there makes the omission of <b>movies</b> glaring. It doesn't have a DVD drive on it... so let me get this right... it's a TV that you can't actually watch TV on, or movies, or DVD's.</p>

 But what if you want to watch music videos, movie trailers, podcasts, and photos on TV?

<p>C'mon Apple what if you want to watch TV or DVD on your Apple TV?</p>
<p>And this comes from someone with 2 MacBooks, 2 Mac Mini's, 2 iPods and lots of gadgets. I don't think I'd buy non Apple again. But I'm not buying the Apple TV. Someone said that in Apple they justify a new product by saying "Whats the TV commercial like". Someone was asleep when they said in a meeting "You can watch movie trailers on it".</p>
