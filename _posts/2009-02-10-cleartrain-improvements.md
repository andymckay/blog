<p>Got a nice email from Joel Davis with some great improvements for <a href="http://www.cleartrain.ca">Cleartrain</a>. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not showing all the past trainings, I checked my view and I had the query going back 20 days, that was silly.</li>
<li>Showing past trainings a little differently.</li>
<li>Making it clear you can do and then remove multiple filters.</li>
</ul>
<p>One nice feature that isn't clear is that the RSS, Atom and iCal feeds all alter depending upon your filters. So a list of all say Python or Django training, is pretty easy. I need to find a nice UI way of improving that. Anyway thanks for the feedback on Cleartrain, it's been good so far, let's keep the trainings rolling in.</p>
<p>Another thing I found interesting is the number of trainings on Plone. Although Plone isn't necessarily the most popular project out there, <a href="http://plone.org">plone.org</a> does provide a very good platform for providing information on training. Something that some other projects (eg. Django) do quite differently.</p>
