<p>In a previous blog post I talked about <a href="https://mckay.pub/blog/andy/2317/">why you should attend a user group</a>, in this one I wanted talk about some of the things I've found useful in running a user group.</p>
<ul>
<li>Announce with plenty time in advance (at least 3 weeks) what's happening so that people have time to plan. Then follow up with a reminder a day or two beforehand.</li>
<li>A web page and a mailing list. Recently I've switched Vancouver Python over to <a href="http://meetup.com">Meetup.com</a> and that's working well, but if paying for Meetup.com isn't your thing, don't worry about it.</li>
<li>Decide upon the format and let people know what the format is. I've seen two work well:
<ul>
<li>Someone does a talk for 40 minutes plus. People then break away for a beer or other social event.</li>
<li>A 5 minute talk (which usually turns out to be much longer if a discussion breaks out) from each person in the group.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A venue that can seat enough people with access to projector, screen and so on. Don't forget a dongle or two for those annoying Mac users.</li>
<li>It has to be somewhere quiet. We've tried bars a few times and even back rooms are hard to have conversations that more than a few people can here. Bars are fine for socialising, but don't try and have a talk that more than 5 people can hear.</li>
<li>Beer and pizza and other refreshments are optional, I've run groups either way and haven't really noticed a difference. Either way let people know beforehand.</li>
<li>Don't change the time and event unless something obvious is happening (e.g.: Stanley Cup final). There's nothing worse than someone moving an event forward 10 minutes or so just because.</li>
<li>Have someone take notes. These days we just have an etherpad session open and let everyone type in that while people talk there's one at <a href="http://typewith.me">typewith.me</a> and also the Mozilla one.</li>
<li>After the event send round the notes within a day or so. Don't worry about how quickly you do it, now matter how fast someone will always email you and ask you to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things like be nice, respectful and inclusive all go without saying, of course.</p>
<p>...and if you are an open source Vancouver user group looking for a space, drop me a line and we should be able to sort you out something at Mozilla.</p>
