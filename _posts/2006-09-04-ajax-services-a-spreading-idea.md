This just got onto Slashdot, <a href="http://cows-ajax.sourceforge.net">COWS Ajax.</a> Spookily enough this is exactly what I was blogging about last week or so. Sometimes things hit all at once. A quick peek at COWS and it has:
<ul>
	<li>A server side library written in PHP. I don't know much PHP so I can't comment on that. </li>
	<li>A client side library written in JS that connects to the back end.</li>
	<li>An example client side spell checker</li>
</ul>

To quote the site:
<blockquote>The trick is that the URL of the script is not pointing to a javascript file, but instead pointing to something like a PHP or other backend.</blockquote>
Looks like an implementation of <a href="https://mckay.pub.ca/blog/index.php?p=50">Ajax Services</a> to me. I would really like to see more implementations of AjaxProxy, so something in PHP would be really nice if anyone knows more than me it would be great to see.
