<p>Just spent some time hacking on ClearSpell 1.1, getting spell checking working on Kupu was frustrating me so I went back to this code. Once I got accessing the DOM of an iframe sorted it was pretty straightforward. So it now works with Kupu and the spell check links are now much more unobtrusive. Would need some testing before it goes in the wild, still prototype code, but getting there.</p>
