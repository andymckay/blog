One interview question I used to ask of developers: "What one characteristic is
the most important for software developers?". The actual answer didn't matter
too much as the justification and follow on. One response that I like is
*tenacity*.

As a software developer you spend all day solving challenges, it's mentally
challenging and hard work. As soon as you are faced with a problem you start
finding solutions and keep going until you've got one. That takes tenacity.

<blockquote>
<b>tenacious |təˈnāSHəs|</b>
adjective
tending to keep a firm hold of something; clinging or adhering closely: a tenacious grip.
not readily relinquishing a position, principle, or course of action; determined:
</blockquote>

I think tenacity is important, you need it to keep focused. Some problems
aren't simple, the answers don't come easily and all too often people look for
the easy way out.

But take the other side. Once upon a time I used to work on Plone. Plone wasn't
an easy system, we were making it up as we went along and some things were
pretty complicated.

Clients would ask us for solutions and we'd sweat for hours, sometimes days, on
how to make simple changes. "Move that thing from that part of the page to the
other? Sure, how hard can that be?"

When we worked our way through the overly complicated solution there was an
amazing sense of relief at satisfaction at what we'd done. It was amazing,
the work we were doing and we felt great. We had brains and tenacity. We were
awesome and smart.

Then I stopped doing it. Later I looked back and realised it wasn't always
awesome. We were caught in a tangled web of ideas and concepts - some of them
half baked, some of them over-engineered, some of them for completely
different purpose and some of them were just down right crap.

But the feeling was great, we were getting stuff done despite all this. Were we
though? We'd fallen into a kind of development Stockholm Syndrome. The code was
too complicated, too convoluted and we spent hours fighting it and loving the
feeling of mastery it gave us when we kicked it's butt.

It was an illusion. Just because something is complicated for you to learn and
do doesn't mean its right and doesn't give you job security or satisfaction
in the long run.

Eventually someone smarter than you will figure out you are being an ass
and build the right tool for the job and then kick your butt. The fighting
every day was a path to ruin.

I'll still take tenacity as an answer, you need it. Just make sure it doesn't
become stubbornness.
