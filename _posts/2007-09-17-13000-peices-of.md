<p>There I was on the plane back from Canada. Fleeting worries about carbon emissions passed through my heads but every time I get my lunch in those plastic boxes by the gazillion I want to scream. For each of us there was a plastic bag. Inside the plastic bag was a plastic bag. Inside the plastic bag inside the plastic bag was a plastic bag. This was actually a rubbish bag. You hung it on your seat back and put in it the plastic bag and the other plastic bag. Then all the other junk.</p>
<p>Then think about how the hell the world is going to be around for your grandchildren.</p>
