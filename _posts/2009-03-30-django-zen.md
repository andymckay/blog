<p>If you are following this blog for Django things then it might get a little bit quieter. This weekend I started up <a href="http://djangozen.com">djangozen.com</a> a website devoted to lots of stuff about Django. There is already a Django website of course and lots of other sites with useful Django stuff on them, but on the whole there are some things I think are missing. If you want to know more about that sort of stuff, go <a href="http://djangozen.com/about/">read the about page</a>.</p>
<p>Technically DjangoZen uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plone as the content writing and managing interface</li>
<li>Django as the delivery interface, using Postgresql</li>
<li>Contentmirror copies content (mostly) into Postgresql</li>
<li>Used jQuery for lots of fun bits</li>
<li>I got annoyed with all the OpenID libraries and implemented my own based off django-openidauth.</li>
<li>I use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blue Print CSS</a> framework and was very happy with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to adding in more features and writing some content.</p>
