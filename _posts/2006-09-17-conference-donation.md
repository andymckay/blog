I just completed the accounts for the the conference and sent the money to the PSF. As per the <a href="http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/09/vancouver-python-and-zope-user-group.html">blog post</a>:

<blockquote>The Vancouver Python Zope User Group has donated the proceeds of the 2006 Vancouver Python Workshop, amounting to CAD$5770, to the Python Software Foundation. The PSF thanks the user group for their support.</blockquote>

Thank you to everyone for coming. After two conferences, we are now totalling almost $10,000 in donations to the PSF.
