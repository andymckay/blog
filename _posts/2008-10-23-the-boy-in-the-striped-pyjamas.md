<p>Went to see the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914798/">The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</a> tonight. I knew going in it was going to be a subject (the Holocaust) that I feel uncomfortable about. There's nothing like watching films about that subject to really start to hate humanity (and last night we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092804/">Cry Freedom</a>).</p>
<p>It was one of the, most moving films I've seen in a long time, would highly recommend it. At the credits it was dead quiet and hardly anyone moved. But I've no idea why the hell its rated as 12A, perhaps I'm being overly protective but I just can't see myself taking my 12 year old daughter there. Whilst things like sex and violence aren't present, the subject is quite complex. The boy behind me asked a few times, "what kind of camp is it?".</p>
