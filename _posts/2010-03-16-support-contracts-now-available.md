<p>We've had several clients request long term support after the initial project has been completed.  To meet those needs, we've begun offering support contracts for <a href="http://clearwind.ca/support/">Django, Plone and Python based projects</a>.  That means if something blows up or if you just have a question about code, we'll be there to help.</p>
