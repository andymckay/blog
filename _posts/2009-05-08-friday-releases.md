<p>In defiance of the basic wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>Don't release anything on a Friday</blockquote>
<p>I released some new stuff on a Friday.</p>
<p>Arecibo actually got the biggest release, which is a completely new database structure behind the scenes. On the front-end there's a new look and feel. With that release in place I can now roll out the new features that have been queueing up on the site. Once all the database is re-indexed and all good, I'll put out an announcement on the <a href="http://www.areciboapp.com/blog/">Arecibo blog</a> about it. Just polishing those last few things now.</p>
<p>For doing the migration I used <a href="http://south.aeracode.org/">South</a> and I have to say it's pretty good. Looking forward to using that in the future.</p>
<p>DjangoZen got a few little bits of polish. I've also added in a job board. It's slightly sparse at the moment, due to no jobs being present. But if you are looking for a django developer, now is a <a href="http://www.djangozen.com/jobs/">good time to enter a job</a>, then send me a list of bugs about the problems with the job board :) Jobs are free at the moment.</p>
