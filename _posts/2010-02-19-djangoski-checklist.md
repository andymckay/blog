<p>Sadly Matt Berg won't be able to make it DjangoSki. Far too busy at the moment in Uganda working on the next version of Child Count. That's a shame, we'll get him next year when he's had time to catch up on his skiing a bit ;).</p>
<p>Very fortunate to have Brian Leroux, a self described "software hack" from <a href="http://nitobi.com">Nitobi</a> coming to speak in Matt's place. Brian works on mobile apps and things like PhoneGap, XUI and Lawnchair.</p>
<p>Checklist for DjangoSki:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laptop</li>
<li>Passport (for any non-Canadians that is) 
<li>Skis / snowboards and gear</li>
<li>Hot tub gear</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a few sprint topics planned <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoSki">on the wiki</a>, but if you've got your own, please come ready with those ideas.</p>
