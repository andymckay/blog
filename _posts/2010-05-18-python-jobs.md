<p>Over the last few months I've seen a real up trend in Python jobs available. I follow Python jobs, because it's a good way to spot consulting opportunities. It's also good to be surprised when you find someone local using Python that you didn't know about.</p>
<p>For Python developers there's 3 companies that always seem to be sucking up all the Python programmers: <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://canonical.com">Canonical</a> and <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>. Out of people I can think of off the top of my head, I think these 3 companies account for over 50% of the developers I know of. Perhaps it's because my circle of friends is small, but these you can pretty much guess when someone says that they've been hired - it's one of these three.</p>
<p>Canonical is probably a little more unusual than the other projects, in that they use quite a lot of the <a href="http://wiki.zope.org/zope3/ComponentArchitecture">ZCA</a>. So if you are looking for a job there, might be a good idea to research that a little bit first.</p>
<p>These aren't the only ones, I seem to know more people at <a href="http://www.mochimedia.com/">Mochimedia</a> every day.</p>
<p>Django is certainly providing a lift to Python:</p>
<blockquote>Django powers over 80% of Python-coded web sites, according to some estimates</blockquote>

<p>The recent TechCrunch 50 winner <a href="http://www.redbeacon.com/">RedBeacon</a> was running Django, and so do an awful lot of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=750142">new startups</a>.</p>
<p>I don't really have an stats to back all this up, I should probably write a Python script to do that. But I do think a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The days when Python is just an afterthought attached to a system administration job description are on the decline.</li>
<li>It's a good time to learn Python.</li>
</ul>
