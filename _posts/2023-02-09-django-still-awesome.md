I first started using Django in 2008. That's forever ago in internet terms, as a I left Zope and Plone for something better. Later on I got a job at Mozilla doing Django full time, but then became a Manager and then moved on. I haven't written Django for anything more than quick side projects for a very long time.

But in the last couple of weeks I've stood up a couple of projects on Django. Honestly its been an experience in learning and remembering how this stuff works. It's been a lot of fun. I've stood up two Django sites since then and it's as I remember, just better.

I'm a big fan of making exciting things with boring technology and after all this time Django is one of those "boring" technologies that just works really well.

Still a fan and that's a credit to the people and the community that have kept Django going. Well done to all of you.

Still prefer to Rails ðŸ˜€
