<p>Shane Hathaway is a great Zope developer from many years ago - well respected for great code. After four years of doing other stuff, he's just posted that he's back doing <a href="http://shane.willowrise.com/archives/back-to-python-zope-and-plone/">Python, Zope and Plone</a>, that's great news.</p>
