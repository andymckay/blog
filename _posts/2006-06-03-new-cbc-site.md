A new CBC site has been launched and looks quite nice so far. One nice change is that in a nice post, the person in charge has described <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/launch/" target="_blank">what and why</a>, for example:  <blockquote> We&#39;ve added prominent links to RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds in the left-hand navigation of all of the news pages, so you can easily subscribe to feeds and get the news you want... </blockquote>  Good stuff.
