<p>Yesterday, stepped off the plane back into Vancouver for the first time in 9 months. It's taken me until now to sink in that I really do like Canada, there wasn't that sort of immediate "ah i'm home feeling". Probably due to the intense tiredness of the long day, the girl's that wouldn't sleep on the plane and the sorting ourselves out.</p>
<p>Today was more relaxing, walking our dog Bob, who I do miss a huge amount, sorting out car insurance and the like. Walking Bob took me down through some wonderful woods in Deep Cove, out around the cove and back. We dinner out at the local Sushi place, my favourite one was closed, but the sushi was good. Now I'm sat looking over Belcara and Indian Arm.</p>
<p>I do like Canada, especially Deep Cove. Twenty one days left before the flight home to England.</p>
