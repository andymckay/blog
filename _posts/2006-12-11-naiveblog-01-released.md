<img align="right" src="http://www.agmweb.ca/files/naive-blog.png" />There is lots of blogging software out there for Plone and a lot of is very complicated. I don't need any of these things in a blog. I don't need custom skins or ui. I don't need a workflow. So all I really need is what NaiveBlog gives me. A content type that's a copy of News Item and a smart folder that shows them.

It's called NaiveBlog for a reason.
