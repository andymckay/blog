If you play Final Fantasy XI, then there are quite a few hacks out there that you can try. I've been playing it for a while and here's a simple one, swap your moogle for something else. All you are doing is changing the .dat file that renders the image of the moogle. There's something mildly amusing about asking a Gigas to do your gardening for example, although it is freaky the first time you go into your Mog house.

A list of the files is here and a description:
