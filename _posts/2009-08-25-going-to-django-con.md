<p>In a couple of weeks it will be time to head down to <a href="http://www.djangocon.org/">Django Con</a>. Looking forward to meeting a whole bunch of Django people. I'll be giving two talks and it would be great to see you there.</p>
<p>The first is entitled "What the Heck went Wrong" and is aimed at more novice developers and focuses on debugging techniques and tools. From how to do a simple print statement to tools like Django Debug Toolbar.</p>
<p>The second is "Fighting Malnutrition with SMS and Django" and covers the great work being done by the <a href="http://www.rapidsms.org/">RapidSMS team</a> and my brief involvement with it. It's a longer talk that covers an innovative use of Django and some sample code for using Django in a slightly different environment.</p>
<p>Also sad to note tonight that at the moment both <a href="http://djangoplugables.com/">djangopluggables</a> and <a href="http://djapp.org/">djapp</a> are both offline. Yet <a href="http://djangozen.com/app">djangozen</a> is still chugging along.</p>
