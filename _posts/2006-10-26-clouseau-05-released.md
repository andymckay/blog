Clouseau 0.5 features a load and save ability. You can take your session that you've spent 10 minutes and click "Save" to save it to your local file system. They can then they be loaded back in, returning you to your original state.

Just to make any security hole in Clouseau bigger, it can now load sessions from URL's. <em>Meaning you can have code on plone.org, or say paste.plone.org and automatically pull it into Clouseau</em>. Look for recipes about to appear soon.
