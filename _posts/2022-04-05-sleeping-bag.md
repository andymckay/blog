My sleeping bags are optimized for what I started doing in my old age, camping now and again in the summer when its hot. If I barely needed a sleeping bag? That's the time to go camping.

Not so with the crazy bike packing trips I had in mind. I need something better.

By better it needed to be:
* Lightweight
* Pack down small
* Warm and cope with a couple of seasons

I ended up with:

Its ultralight at 340g, made with ethically sourced down. It covers a couple of seasons of the year. It packs down really small and in my quick test seemed ultra warm.

**Current status:** I haven't actually slept overnight in it yet.
