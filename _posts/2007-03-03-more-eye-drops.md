Well, as we expected, 24 hours after we started Sam on the eye drops, Emily's eyes started to run green goo too. Turns out she is much better at having eye drops put in than I expected. It still takes 2 of us to do it, but if one of us cradles her gently, she doesn't struggle too much. If I try to do it myself, though, it's next to impossible! I'm getting good at doing Sams though. Both of them have cleared up a lot, but we have to keep doing the drops for 5-7 days. Ugh!
