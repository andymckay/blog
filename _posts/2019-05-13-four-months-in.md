Checking in with my [four month goals](http://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/).

* Lost a couple of pounds but keep going up and down. Still struggling with this. My diet is still not good.

* Diet has fallen completely and this is where I need to get back on track.

* Running was amazing in April. We continually did longer and longer runs 14km, 16km, 18km, 19km, 21km runs. Only once when I decided to run the last 3km at 5:30 min/km pace did I feel totally exhausted after.

* I haven't been to the gym in ages.

* But most of all...

I did [a half marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/2344462557)! I didn't die! I didn't walk!

Seriously most of the half marathon was actually quite fun. It started out in Queen Elizabeth park and headed downtown, around Stanley Park and into downtown.

Until about 17km I was doing great with a sub 6 min/km pace, but I hit the proverbial wall in the last few km. The run uphill towards the finish (at 5:27 min/km pace I'll add) was brutal. I ended up starting off with friends, but then running the whole thing by myself, which was probably the best thing.

Pretty proud of that one and I'll have to beat my 2 h 8 min time next year.
