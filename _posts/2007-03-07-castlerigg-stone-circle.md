<p>Went up to the Lake District last weekend and stopped by Castlerigg stone circle. Coming from Vancouver everything is about 1/10th scale. But everything has a history, a name. Every last bump. I spent half the drive up (especially going past places like Rydal Water) tell Danae of times I spent there as a kid.</p>

<p>Was a good day, except for the rain :)</p>
