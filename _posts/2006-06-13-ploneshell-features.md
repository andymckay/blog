Ever used <a href="http://plone.org/products/ploneshell/">PloneShell</a> and want some more features for it? Joel and I are running a <a href="http://plone.org/events/sprints/vandevtools-sprint/">sprint in Vancouver</a> and looking for features people want in it. Here's what we have on our list so far:
<ul>
	<li>Faster start up</li>
	<li>Ability to change colours, fonts</li>
        <li>Easier startup, without having to specify all the paths</li>
        <li>Mac installer</li>
	<li>Reset without having to restart</li>
	<li>Turn off acquisition, only show methods and properties on the current object</li>
	<li>Easy user switching</li>
	<li>Easy security testing</li>
</ul>
