<p>Is ticking away just nicely on <a href="http://github.com/andymckay/arecibo">github</a>. You can now happily consider that a stable stand alone version you can just take off the github shelf and install. At some point we'll start doing formal releases, but for the moment, its kind of nice not too.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks we've added in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users and security (and some doc's around that)</li>
<li>RSS feeds</li>
<li>Errors have a concept of being read</li>
<li>Some actual CSS to make it pretty</li>
</ul> 
<p>So just filtering and notifications to go. I have to say the filtering in Arecibo is a bit whacky "it seemed like a good idea at the time" so we'll have to work on that.</p>
