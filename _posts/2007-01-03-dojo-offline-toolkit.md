From <a href="http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-dojo-offline-toolkit/" target="_blank">Brad Neuberg</a> the Dojo offline toolkit. <blockquote> Let&rsquo;s look at the Dojo Offline Toolkit from a user&rsquo;s perspective. Imagine Alex is using a web-based real estate application for realtors built with the Dojo Offline Toolkit. In the upper-right corner of this web application is a button that says &quot;Work Offline.&quot; The first time Alex clicks on this button, a small window appears informing him that this web application can be accessed and used even if he is offline. </blockquote> I&#39;ve been rambling on about such a toolkit to anyone who&#39;ll listen to me the last few months and toying with tools to do just that. Of course I&#39;ve produced nothing but ideas, hopefully someone who actually does things, like Brad, might produce something.
