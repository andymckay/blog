I've recently set up a website through Shutterfly to try and sell some of my photos. People keep telling me how great my pictures are, so I thought I'd give this a try. If you go to <a href="http://www.clearwind.ca/photography">www.clearwind.ca/photography</a> this will take you to my Shutterfly page. So far I have put up mostly flower photos, but there are also some animals, birds, and "other nature" photos. <br/><br/>

Please take a look and tell me what you think. (And of course, feel free to buy!)
