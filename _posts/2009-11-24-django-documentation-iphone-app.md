<p>We've released iPhone app that contains all the Django documentation. Basically we took the documentation, reformatted it a bit to try and fit on the iPhone and then pushed it all into PhoneGap. Unfortunately there was then a 5 week wait as Apple thought about approving it.</p>
<p>The app has just now been approved and is on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/django-documentation/id336551222?mt=8&uo=6">app store</a>. There's more information on the <a href="http://www.clearwind.ca/apps/django-documentation.html">Clearwind site, here</a>.</p>
<p>There's a few things we'd like to improve like: reducing the memory footprint, remembering the last page and indexing in spotlight. I'm not sure how many of those things will be possible, but we'll keep the app to date with the latest docs.</p>
<p>And the best thing is, 30 cents out of every app sale goes to the Django Software Foundation.</p>
