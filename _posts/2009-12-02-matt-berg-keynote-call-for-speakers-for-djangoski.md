<p>For our final keynote I'm pleased to say that <a href="http://www.clearwind.ca/djangoski/keynotes.html">Matt Berg</a> will be speaking at <a href="http://www.clearwind.ca/djangoski">DjangoSki</a>.</p>
<p>Matt Berg is the ICT Coordinator on the <a href="http://www.millenniumvillages.org/">Millenium Villages Project</a> at Columbia University. As part of that
                project he's been building technical systems in developing countries. He's involved with <a href="http://www.rapidsms.org/">RapidSMS</a> and projects include
                work in Kenya, South Senegal, Malawi and Rwanda that help children with malaria and malnutrition. And it's all using open source software and Django.</p>
<p>Not only does Matt do interesting work that is helping people right now, but he passionately believes that he can use Django and other technologies to make a difference. His passion and dedication is infectious, as you'll find out.</p>
<p>We have room for other speakers at the conference, so we'd like to call for other speakers to submit proposals to speak at the conference.
