I've been a big fan of [Tangerine](https://www.tangerine.ca) for a while, it's a bank that doesn't charge fees and does what I need to do. They used to have a great app and website and then it all went a bit wrong.

It's now a HTML app for Desktop and mobile. This isn't the fault of the tools used, but there's some terrible choices in the app across both.

### Notifications

On my phone I get the notification number on my app screen. So, I open up the app and I get this little message:

But, you can't click on it. It's not a link, to find your notifications you have to go to `Profile & Settings`, scroll down to `Inbox` and then you can access the notifications. If notifications that are that important, how about you put a way to access them somewhere obvious.

Here's a notification:

### Space

When you open the app, a full 1/3 of the screen is an advert:

Let's dismiss that:

Oh come on Tangerine. I'm not logging into my phone to get "Insights", otherwise known as "Advertising". Stop taking up space with this crap.

### Cancelling

Pop quiz. You are cancelling this transaction. What does the `Cancel` button do?

The `Cancel` button cancels the cancelling. The highlighted option `Confirm` actually continues the cancelling. You know what would be clearer? `Yes` or `No`.

### Cluttered

Supposing I wanted to see my transactions on an account. There's about one half of the screen to scroll down. The black text `Posted Transactions` doesn't actually do anything. The transaction list is an infinite scroll. So instead they've put everything at the top of the page, such as `Search`, `Transaction Breakdown` and so on.

Then there's another title `Transactions`. Do you get the idea that in those 5 boxes saying `Transactions`, this might be about...

### Overall

The overall feel of the app is that its full of spinners, far too cluttered and just to confusing. Hey not everything I've built is perfect, but even I can spot some real problems with this app. I pretty sure Tangerine can do better than this.

And yes, I'm writing this while drinking a beer I recently bought, as shown on my transaction page.

I'd still recommend Tangerine and their credit card. If you want to open an account, use my key: `20790922S1` to give get yourself a bonus.
