<p>Went to the coolest cinema ever last night. It's the  <a href="http://www.palacecinema.supanet.com/">Palace in Longridge</a>. It has one screen, its not too loud, it shows one movie a week, has charming staff, the seats are large and comfy. It costs 4.50. They even play the God Save the Queen before the movie.</p>
<p>But best of all. No expensive overpriced sugar drinks. Want a drink? <b>You get a cup of tea. In a mug</b>. None of this polystrene disposable crap. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Compared to the super mega hyper multi plex cinemas it's a blessed relief and worth going to again.</p>
