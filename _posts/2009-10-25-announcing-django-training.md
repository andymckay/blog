<p>I'm pleased to announce that in January 2010 I'll be running <a href="http://clearwind.ca/training">Django Training</a> in Vancouver. The four day training covers all the things you need to know about getting Django up and running. The training is very hands-on - a bit of talking and then a bit of writing code.</p>
<p>Since it's in Vancouver in the winter, we also thought we'd throw in a nights skiing up <a href="http://www.cypressmountain.com/index.asp">Cypress Mountain</a> (where the Olympic free-style skiing and snowboarding will be held). After many years of skiing I still consider myself quite an amateur, so that will be another opportunity for me to learn from you.</p>
<p>After several years of Plone training, I'm really looking forward to doing some Django training. Hope to <a href="mailto:training@clearwind.ca">see you here</a>.</p>
