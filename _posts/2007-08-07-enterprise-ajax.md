<p>I met Andre Charland for lunch about a year ago when his company was called eBusiness Applications and mine was called Enfold. A nice, exceedingly bright chap - building a company out of providing quality Ajax tools. At the time he told me he was writing a book whilst building a company. My reply was something like "poor you, you'll be glad when the book is out". It is now out congratulations <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-AJAX-Strategies-Performance-Applications/dp/0132242060/ref=sr_1_1/105-3058698-4378042?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186513708&sr=1-1">Andre Charland</a>.</p>
