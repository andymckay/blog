I wanted to look at some numbers from the Teachers conflict. The teachers are asking for
10.75% + 2.75% over 4 years. That's 3.375% each year.

The BCPSEA have offered 7.25% over 6 years. That's 1.21% a year.

That's essentially a pay cut over the next 6 years, since the cost of living increases are
more likely

But I was slightly interested in how that compares to what has happened in the last 13 years.
Because we can all see how greedy the teachers are. According to the Fraser Institute:

<blockquote>They signed a generous collective agreement in 2006 that gave them
average wage increases of 2.5 per cent over five years,</blockquote>

Oh really? Let's just look at that.

As far as I can tell this is the salary increase and inflation increase each
year since 2000:

Let's put that in some pretty graphs. If a teacher started on $30k salary and
got no promotions or increase or salary from any other source:

Inflation vs wage increases:

Basically teachers are barely keeping up with inflation. When contracts get negotiated, they
get slightly above inflation. Then there's years without a change. As you can see the
raises aren't huge and over the long term just about track inflation.

A headline figure like "13.5% over 4 years" grabs the headlines and makes the teachers sound
greedy, but its just not true.

Can we just get teachers salaries pegged with cost of living increases and get that
out of the way and move on to the other stuff?
