<p>Move over Clouseau there's a new tool on the development block. <a href="http://weblion.psu.edu/blog/esteele/gloworm-0-1-alpha1-now-available/view">Gloworm</a> provides a:</p>
<blockquote>poke-that-thing-on-the-page-and-tell-me-more-about-it-style</blockquote>
<p>interface that allows you to poke and play with objects right in the user interface, a la Firebug.</p>
<p>Congratulations and good luck getting this out the door. Then once that is done we should take Clouseau and mash the two together (including Gloworm's much nicer style) to provide some serious kick ass development tools. Great job Eric!</p>
