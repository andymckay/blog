For some reason I was thinking about this on the bus and it's stuck with me. Was in London Drugs many moons ago (about 4 years) buying a television. As I remember the conversation went something like this
<blockquote>
Customer: I'm looking for a tv.
Salesman: Great, so the main question is, how big is your car?
Customer: Well it's a truck.
Salesman: Excellent, so this tv here is a great buy and will fit in the back of your truck.
Customer: Yeah it would.
</blockquote>
Customer is now totally distracted from the cost, focusing on the <em>size</em> of the tv. He was good and was selling a truck load of televisions as we bought a few other bits and peices with a very, very slow salesman.
