<p>So there I was doing 16 things in the kitchen making dinner and some soup at the same time, talking to kids etc. We've got one of those electric hobs where you can't tell what burner is hot. Move pots around. See a hob with no pan but food bits on it. Forgot which one was hot. Use my hand to wipe the hob. Idiot.</p>
<p>Four hours later my fingers had calmed down, but I've got quite a lot burns on my left hand. I've mastered a different style of typing now. Idiot.</p.
