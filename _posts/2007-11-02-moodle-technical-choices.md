<p>Had the pleasure of meeting Martin Dougiamas the other day. A thoroughly nice chap and had a brief chat with Martin about Moodle. I confessed I had problems with Moodle, being used to an object model like Zope. A few interesting things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many years ago Martin tried his first prototype in Zope, he likes Python  and thought it would be a good fit. He got ZODB corruptions (this was about 2001-2) and gave up on the ZODB and Zope.</li>
<li>Having it in PHP makes it very easy and accesible for new users.</li>
<li>By not needing root access Moodle has been installed on lots of hosts and often cheap hosts with little hassle.</li>
</ul>
<p>All good points and certainly Moodle is a roaring success.</p>
