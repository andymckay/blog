January 22nd<br /><br />Another result of the big wind storm the other day was the grounding of the cargo ship Napoli, resulting in about 200 containers falling off it and washing ashore on the beaches of Devon. I&#39;ve been reading news stories about it for the last few days and it just sickens me to hear about people raiding the washed up containers and taking things that belong to other people. Would you believe people are selling their &quot;finds&quot; on eBay??!! Of course I&#39;m especially bothered by this as our own container full of our belongings was on the seas during these awful storms - due to dock at Southampton yesterday - and I have no idea whether my stuff will make it here safe and sound or not. I just keep thinking, &quot;That could have been my container on that beach.&quot;
