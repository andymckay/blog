<p>It's all tagged in SVN and ready to roll out on Tuesday, once all the installers and press releases are done. I know its a cliche, but this truly is the biggest and <a href="http://plone.org">best Plone ever</a> with lots of new features that absolutely rock if you haven't seen it in a while.</p>
