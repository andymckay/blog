The definition that is generally used for bike packing is that you are cycling off road on gravel and camping. Bike touring is used when you are staying in accomodation. I like to do both on the same trip and don't care about names. But if I'm going to go camping, I need a tent.

I also plan to do some back packing and the options I currently have are either too big and heavy: a four person or two person tent from MEC, or suit a particular trip - my camping hammock.

So I got a new tent, requirements:
* Light
* Packs small
* Can cope with most conditions
* Simple to put up

I ended up looking at <a href="https://tarptent.com">tarptent</a> and got a <a href="https://www.tarptent.com/product/protrail-li/">ProTrail Li</a>. It's super fast and easy to put up.

You can either carry your own poles, or re-use your own trekking poles. For cycling I've got poles I can use, when I'm backpacking I'll re-use my hiking poles.

Weight is a ridiculous 453g.

It's not designed for winter camping or snow, but that's fine because that's not something I intend to do anytime soon. It is a single wall tent, so we'll see how it does with Pacific Northwest weather.

**Current status:** I put it up in the garden but haven't tried it for reals yet.
