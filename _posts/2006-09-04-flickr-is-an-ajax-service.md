As far as I can tell, Flickr is ready to roll as an Ajax service. It accepts requests using REST and then can respond in XML, using SOAP or XML-RPC. Once transformations are ready to roll on the server, we'll be able to insert the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">Flickr API</a> key in the AjaxProxy as well. Go for it someone!
