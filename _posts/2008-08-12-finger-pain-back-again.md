<p>I got a nice few emails from people regarding my RSI and typing problems a while back. One of the most prescient ones was: "Don't ignore it, it will come back".</p>
<p>The doctor gave me some pills to take down the inflamation and we've been on a couple of holidays. Things calmed down. I came back from holidays no problem for a few days. But a few weeks into the current contract and my producitivity is plummeting and the pain has increased worse than before.</p>
<p>I tried to order a Kinesis keyboard (pictured) but got caught by them trying to ship it to my credit card address (Canada). The pain I had yesterday, which by the end of the day was bloody awful, caused me to suck it up and blow $400 dollars on a keyboard. We'll see how that goes.</p>
