<p>Oh cry me a river, so Comcast is imposing a bandwidth cap of 250gb. Bleepin' heck. Come live in a third world country like the UK where you get 15gb a month. And that costs an arm and a leg.</p>

Its survey found that 56% of broadband providers who advertised services as "unlimited" did impose usage caps and were prepared to cut people off if they used their service to excess.
