This release has a few ui fixes and a few minor bug fixes. It comes with auto-complete. As you type away you'll see the auto complete below the prompt area. Clicking tab will auto-complete the text. Makes getting to those key elements very quick and easy.

Remember, installing DocFinderTab will give you more complete tool tips. This will make Clouseau feature complete, now we have to push to a 1.0 release with lots of bug fixes and cleanup.
