This week I made an effort to work on my blog and sometimes these things can work out to be way easier than you might think. Installing Wordpress and Subversion were as simple as apt-get install <em>packagename</em>, freaky.

Compare that to installing previous components especially the nightmarishly complicated CVS and life just seems to easy.
