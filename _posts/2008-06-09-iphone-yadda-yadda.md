<p>Finally it's got the 3G and GPS and I need. But more importantly, according to Apple's websites, it's officially coming to Canada on July 11th. Canada doesn't have any official iPhone at all at the moment. The real question about when I land back in Canada is, should I go straight to the new Apple store, or go and see the in-laws first?</p>
