Checking in with my [five month goals](http://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/).

* Holy crap it's been this long.

* Lost a couple of pounds and finally got back on track with my diet. Not as good as it could be, but getting better.

* Still stuggle with eating too much after exercise.

* I'm doing a lot of exercise and I'm back cycling now, yay! Did 127 km bike ride followed by an 80 km bike ride this weekend for example. Yeah I was tired.

* Still running a couple of days a week around 5km ish. Need to bring that back up to 8 and 10km and still keep cycling.

* I haven't been to the gym in ages.

* I've got a plan for cycling through to the Fondo. Damn holidays keep getting in the way though.
