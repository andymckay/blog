Since curlers were kicked out of the North Shore Winter Club, there are no curling facilities on the North Shore of Vancouver. Currently we have to travel to New Westminster to go curling. Here's a list of municipalities in Vancouver, population and number of curling clubs.

The [Township of Langley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langley,_British_Columbia_(district_municipality)#/media/File:GVRD_Langley_district.svg) is a large area, with the city at its centre and a curling club there.

With zero curling rinks, Burnaby is a standout, however with curling rinks in Vancouver, New Westminster, Coquitlam and Port Moody, it has curling rinks in every adjoining area.

With a combined population of 190,410 for West Vancouver, District of North Vancouver and the City of North Vancouver, there are 0 curling rinks.

Most of this data is from [Curling Canada website](https://www.curling.ca/about-curling/getting-started-in-curling/find-a-curling-centre/) which has several inaccuracies, unfortunately.

Notes.

* The [Glanford Curling Club](http://www.glanfordcurling.com/) is in Ontario, not Coquitlam sorry Curling Canada, got that one wrong.
* The [Delta Thistle Curling Club](https://deltathistle.ca/) is not listed on the Curling Canada site.
* The [North Shore Winter Club](http://www.nswc.ca/curling.html) does not have curling.
* The [Hollyburn Country Club](https://www.hollyburn.org/nor) does not have curling.
