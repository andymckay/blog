**My goal**: I'm going to beat last years time of 4:19 and do the [Whistler Gran Fondo](https://www.rbcgranfondo.com/whistler/) in September 2019 in 4 hours.

That seems absurdly ridiculous on the face of it, but the fact that I was able to shave off 23 minutes this year was nothing short of miraculous to me. So let's try shaving off another 19 minutes. How am I going to do this?

1. Get serious about losing weight again. I've done it in the past and then I revert. This year I'm aiming for a race weight of 160 lbs. In the past I've been around 180 lbs by the time I do the Gran Fondo. 

2. Improve my watts per kg. The amount of power you can output is important so I've got to lose weight without losing muscle. I did an estimated 236w power last Fondo, if I can do the some power output and weigh less I'll push up my time.

Actual things I'm going to do to meet these goals:

1. Do a half marathon. I'm in the [BMO Half](https://bmovanmarathon.ca/) in May. I've done 4 10k races so far and I found the last one a bit slow and painful. I need to get comfortable at doing 5k every day and a 10k regularly.

2. Cycle regularly in the [Steed group 2](https://steedcycles.com/ride-clubs/). That's the faster group than I normally ride in.

3. Complete the [Seymour Hill Climb](https://www.strava.com/segments/612178?filter=current_year) in under 1 hour. My top time is 1:15:34 and according to Strava I'm 4924 / 6151. There's room for improvement there.

4. Do lots of work at the gym to work on my core, leg and back muscles.

I can totally do this.

**Disclaimer**: I might just say screw it and not do this. It's my life.
