Checking in with my [one month goals](http://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/).

* Lost 12 pounds. Although I did go as much as 15 pounds down, only to come back up again.

* Diet was mostly Keto for a while, but I've slipped into some carbs for running and sometimes have too many carbs. That's probably caused the lack of weight loss.

* Running has dramatically improved. At the beginning of the month I was feeling down because I was going slowly. This last week I completed 7.1k at a sub 6km/minute pace and my training runs are getting faster.

* Signed up for the West Van Run in March, want to beat my time on that from last year - 29 minutes - significantly.

* Set a goal of doing a 10k in under an hour - that's 5 minutes to chop off.

* Gym work has dropped off significantly.

* Haven't had alcohol since 2018 even though I've been to some pubs.

More to do.
