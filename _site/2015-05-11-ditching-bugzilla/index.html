<hr class="florished">
<p>Mozilla wasn&#39;t my first time using Bugzilla. About ten years earlier I worked at ActiveState and spent hours hacking away at Bugzilla with a certain David Ascher to produce an issue tracker for the company.</p>

<p>That was forever ago, when I was a junior who knew nothing and found Bugzilla a bit of a mess. But that was ages ago, software improves and life moves on.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve used Bugzilla every day at Mozilla for Add-ons and the Marketplace. Actually came to like Bugzilla, sort of. But recently we had an opportunity to move onto a new project - and we decided to move issues to GitHub.</p>

<p>Again I&#39;m going to blame David Ascher who one day asked me &quot;Have you tried putting your issues on GitHub?&quot;. I gave a list of reasons why not. Then later on I realised they were mostly bogus and the only real reason had become &quot;Because that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done.&quot;</p>

<p>The biggest reason I could think of is that GitHub is repository based. As an example... suppose there&#39;s a bug in Payments, where do I file an issue? The payments-server, the payments-ui, the payments-example repository? It&#39;s not project based. So we created a <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/payments">payments</a> repository that&#39;s a catch all for issues and documentation. Problem solved.</p>

<p>By moving to GitHub issues we&#39;ve gained:</p>

<ul>
<li>faster performance</li>
<li>better integration with our code and pull requests</li>
<li>ability to link-in other tools (e.g. <a href="http://waffle.io">http://waffle.io</a>)</li>
<li>lose a whole pile of features, settings and flags we never use</li>
<li>lose getting told off for features that cross products, e.g. the time people removed [perf] off our bugs because that reserved for something in Firefox</li>
</ul>

<p>So far the things we&#39;ve lost are:</p>

<ul>
<li>ability to file security or Mozilla confidential bugs, but for that we just use Bugzilla</li>
</ul>

<p>But so far everything is great.</p>

<p>My favourite thing is using <a href="http://waffle.io">waffle.io</a> which provides us with a Kanban flow across <a href="http://waffle.io/mozilla/payments">multiple repos</a> and is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>I tried to use a similar tool with Bugzilla that an intern wrote. But surprise, the tool wasn&#39;t maintained, didn&#39;t always worked and I ended up maintaining it. I didn&#39;t want to do that, I just want good tools that other people maintain so I can ship my project.</p>

<p>Oh the last downside? When GitHub goes down:</p>

<p>If you are still reading this blog post, I strongly encourage you not to think about ditching Bugzilla, but to think about your entire tool chain set and find new tools and improvements when you can. Oh, and read <a href="http://gregoryszorc.com/blog/">Gregory Szorc&#39;s blog</a>.</p>
