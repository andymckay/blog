<p>I&#39;ve been a bit out of touch recently with holidays, so I&#39;m catching up on the BC teachers situation and what looks like an attempt by the BC Government to destroy public education.</p>

<p>This week the Minister <a href="http://bcparentinfo.ca/">launched a website</a> giving &quot;<a href="http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/b-c-teachers-union-blasts-province-for-media-talks-1.1324577">some of the options available to you</a>&quot;. So what are my options? No public school system? Let&#39;s try private school. Here&#39;s a preliminary search.</p>

<p>My daughters are aged 8 and 10 and enjoy an excellent education in the public school system in French Immersion in North Vancouver, despite the Government. I also consider the school an excellent part of the local community.</p>

<p>Any schooling would ideally be in French and must definitely be non-religious in nature. In North and West Vancouver there are the following private schools and costs to us:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lions Gate Christian Academy: &quot;Moral &amp; Spiritual Development from a Christian Perspective&quot;. Cost: $8,720. Distance: 3.8km. French Immersion: No.</li>
<li>Brockton School: &quot;a rigorous academic education is balanced by arts and athletics in an environment where merit rather than materialism is the core value&quot;. Cost: $29,700. Distance: 10.8km. French Immersion: No.</li>
<li>Collingwood School: &quot;Preparing people to thrive in meaningful lives&quot;. Cost: Not stated. Distance: 19.2km. French Immersion: No.</li>
<li>Mulgrave School: &quot;a caring and supportive school community with high expectations and high levels of achievement&quot;. Cost: $35,940. Distance: 20.3km. French Immersion: No.</li>
<li>Ecole Francaise Internationale de Vancouver: &quot;where critical thought processes and inter-cultural communication are the determining factors&quot;. Cost: $28,500. Distance: 10.4km. French Immersion: Yes.</li>
<li>The Vancouver Waldorf School: &quot;educating hearts and minds&quot;. Cost: $28,240. Distance: 9.3km. French Immersion: No.</li>
</ul>

<p>The highly questionable (<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/polygamous-commune-school-perfect-fraser-institute-1.1071849">if not laughable</a>) Fraser Institute ranking ranks only a couple of these schools. Sherwood Park being just below the average and the West Vancouver schools Mulgrave and Collingwood well above the average.</p>

<p>Note that although I searched for schools on the North Shore, none of these are &quot;local&quot; and we would suffer a disconnect from our local community. Only one provides French Immersion. Lions Gate Christian Academy is definitely not going to happen.</p>

<p>Supposing I can get my children into one of these schools, it would drain my families resources by somewhere from $28k to $36k at the minimum. The median total income <em>before tax</em> in BC is $71k (<a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/famil108a-eng.htm">source</a>), after tax of 40%, let&#39;s say $43k. One of those private schools would consume 65% to 83% of the average after tax income.</p>

<p>As an extra kicker, since my wife is a teacher in the public school system, we have less money this year.</p>

<p>Do you have some realistic options for my family?</p>
