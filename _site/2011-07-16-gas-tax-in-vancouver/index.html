<hr class="florished">
<p>Translink wants to increase gas prices to fund expansion of the skytrain:</p>

<blockquote>a two-cents-a-litre fuel tax to pay for the long-delayed Evergreen Line, a $1.4-billion SkyTrain project that has been stalled for years as governments try to figure out how to help pay for it.</blockquote>

<p><cite><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/bc-politics/mayors-propose-gas-tax-to-fund-transit-line/article2088944/">Globe and Mail</a></cite>
<p>This has promoted some foaming at the mouth for the motoring lobby:</p>
<blockquote>Auto transportation is key to our freedom and prosperity.</blockquote>
<cite><a href="http://www.theprovince.com/news/vancouver/speaks+taxed+motorist/5082608/story.html">The Province</a></cite>
<p>Really? I thought that the vast quantities of resources in BC were the key to prosperity.</p>
<blockquote>TransLink, which features cyclists on its mission page, is decidedly driver-unfriendly.</blockquote>
<cite><a href="http://www.theprovince.com/news/vancouver/speaks+taxed+motorist/5082608/story.html">The Province</a></cite>
<p>There&#39;s not just a picture of a cyclist, there&#39;s a picture of <a href="http://www.translink.ca/en/About-TransLink/Corporate-Overview/Vision-Mission-and-Values.aspx">two cyclists</a> on that page, golly. Yet Translink also seems to fund lots of the <a href="http://www.translink.ca/en/Driving/Roads-and-Bridges.aspx">road network</a> as well (note the truck picture on that page).</p>
<blockquote>Certainly, we need to put the brakes on empire-building transit execs living high off the hog -and start making life easier for the average, taxed-out motorist.</blockquote>

<p>Why is that exactly? Should we all be driving more to work. That&#39;s just ridiculous we <a href="http://cars.uk.msn.com/features/photos.aspx?cp-documentid=158229620&page=15">all</a> <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/article/787400--toronto-commuting-times-worst-of-19-major-cities-study-says">know</a> how that works out.</p>
<p>If the Evergreen line is going to be funded, then increasing the gas tax is the <b>simplest</b> and <b>fairest</b> way to do it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s simplest because the infrastructure already exists to collect the tax. All the needs to be done is to ratchet it up by a few more cents. That&#39;s much simpler than making up a new tax like a <a href="http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=045c1af2-a245-4f2f-bb3f-0aab89ae6711">vehicle levy</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s fairest because its up to the user how much you pay. It is directly related to usage of the transportation infrastructure, unlike say a property tax increase. It discourages the use of gas guzzling cars and that&#39;s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=lower+mainland+air+quality#sclient=psy&hl=en&source=hp&q=lower+mainland+air+quality+health+costs&pbx=1&oq=lower+mainland+air+quality+health+costs&aq=f&aqi=&aql=1&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=6850l8744l2l8879l12l10l0l0l0l0l747l2474l0.1.1.5-2.1l5&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=39b0a615b729321b&biw=996&bih=557">good for everyone</a>. It encourages ride sharing, working from home, shorter commutes and ultimately <b>not driving</b>.</p>
<p>Increases in gas prices are the main way to get serious about conservation, get people into more fuel efficient cars and ultimately onto public transit.</p>
<p>Saying all that, I&#39;m not sure the Evergreen line should be built. I&#39;m still boggled that for years there was no skytrain line out to the airport whilst an extensions was built to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Line">Lougheed Mall</a>. I&#39;ve always thought that a corridor west from commercial to Kits would make more sense. And how about the there and available <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerrisdale">Arbutus Corridor</a> which seems like an easy win to develop.</p></p>
