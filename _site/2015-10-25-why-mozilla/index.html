<h2><a href="/2015-10-25-why-mozilla/">Five years at Mozilla</a></h2>
<hr class="florished">
<p>Today marks five years at Mozilla. On such days people normally write blog posts about the things they&#39;ve accomplished. I want to take a slightly different tack. Recently I was asked in an interview, by a prospective hire:</p>

<p>&quot;Where will you be in five years time, will you still be at Mozilla?&quot;</p>

<p>It was quite an interesting question for an interviewee to ask, and I had to think about it for moment. My answer was this...</p>

<p>&quot;Honestly, I don&#39;t know, maybe. In my career I&#39;ve changed jobs every two years, this is the longest I&#39;ve worked anywhere - I normally get bored.&quot;</p>

<p>I then listed why I&#39;ve been at Mozilla five years:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A mission</strong>: that I can believe in, the Mozilla mission. Sure, it&#39;s got rough days when things don&#39;t make sense, but overall the idea is a good one and I&#39;d like to help out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Awesome people</strong>: everyday I interact with new and great people. <strong>Seriously</strong>. Just recently I started working with <a href="https://twitter.com/mozkev">Kev Needham</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/campd">Dave Camp</a> a lot. What do you know, they&#39;ve been great. There are very, very few people at Mozilla who haven&#39;t been absolutely great... and if they aren&#39;t, they don&#39;t stick around.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Enough freedom</strong>: to spend some time going off and doing something I want to do without asking for permission.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interesting problems</strong>: a reasonably wide variety of interesting problems that I enjoy solving. Coupled with above, the only thing stopping you fixing something is yourself. To borrow a quote from Facebook: <strong>&quot;Nothing at Mozilla is someone else&#39;s problem&quot;</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Career growth</strong>: I&#39;ve moved from being the new developer to taking on more responsibility, to moving into management and then moving up management.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Career challenge</strong>: I&#39;ve moved way outside my comfort zone into working on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">Add-ons</a> and on Firefox itself. A good challenge, something interesting and something new.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No dread</strong>: I don&#39;t dread coming in on Monday like I have on other jobs. I enjoy it, I have optimism about all the great things we can accomplish that week.</p></li>
</ul>

<p></blockquote></p>

<p>From a career point of view, those are pretty good. Will I still be at Mozilla in five years? We&#39;ll see, if the next five years are as good as the last five years.</p>
