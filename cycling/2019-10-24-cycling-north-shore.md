We are in a climate crisis and yet we live in a city that prioritises cars. All the over the place. Just to be clear, North Vancouver is way better off than many other parts of the country, but we've got some serious improvements we can make.

I'm hoping to do a serious of blog posts highlighting what it's like to cycle in North Vancouver - not as a mountain biker or a road biker - but as someone who wants to go about day to day jobs. Shopping. Taking the kids to school. Working. Visiting friends. Normal stuff.

For a start I'm going to focus on the four shopping our tourist areas east of the Seymour river. Deep Cove, Parkgate, Dollarton and Maplewood flats area.

Suppose you want to cycle your bike whats it like when you get there?

Just a disclaimer: I'm a cyclist and want to advance the cause of cycling. When you think how much public land is devoted to private property (cars) and storage of private property (cars) it's pretty mind boggling. Since cycling is better for the someones health, the community, and the environment I think its scandalous that we don't support cycling more.
