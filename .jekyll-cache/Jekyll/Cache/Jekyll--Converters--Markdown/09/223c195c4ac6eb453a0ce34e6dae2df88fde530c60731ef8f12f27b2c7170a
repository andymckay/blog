I"ä<p>Would you believe my mother-in-law found out his name before I did??!! Dad didnâ€™t tell me when he phoned with the news. I knew it was to be Julian and some combination of grandfathersâ€™ names, but didnâ€™t know the final choice. Anyway, turns out my niece Rachael phoned up her granny before going to school and told her of her new cousin Julian James Thomas Nobles, so I only heard from Granny what his full name was to be. Hmph! <br /><br />Jordan has since sent an email with more info (which Iâ€™ve corrected in my previous post) and, more importantly, some photos.<br /><br /><a href="/files/first-look.jpg">Kelly &amp; Julian</a><br /><a href="/files/julian.jpg">Julian</a><br /><a href="/files/j-and-j.jpg">Proud Daddy</a></p>
