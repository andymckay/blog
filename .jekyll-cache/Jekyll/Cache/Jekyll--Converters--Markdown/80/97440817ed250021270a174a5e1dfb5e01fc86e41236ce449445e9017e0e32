<p>A few months ago my wife decided she wanted to rip up the front lawn and replace it with a vegetable garden. With some trepidation, I agreed. This wouldn't be the first project that's been started (by me and my wife) that has ended up half completed. I had visions of a big pile of mud in the front lawn by this time.</p>
<p>Instead she stuck with it. It took a lot of work and we got some help from the neighbours. So now just outside my office I've got a whole collection of vegetables and fruit growing. Peppers, zucchini, beans, peas and peaches. Awesome.</p>
<p>And I've found it incredibly relaxing and satisfying to take a little break from work and wander around the garden. A little bit of weeding, fix the beans, it's a simple job, it doesn't require a huge amount of thinking and is a great break.</p>
<p>Great family fun too .</p>
<p>I think I'd like to keep the back lawn though.</p>
