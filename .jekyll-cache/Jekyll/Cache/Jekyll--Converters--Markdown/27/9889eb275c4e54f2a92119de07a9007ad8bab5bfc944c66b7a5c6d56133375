I"Á<p>I heard the tech news on <a href="http://www.rock101.com/">Rock 101</a> today. Something like:</p>
<blockquote>Microsoft have announced Windows 7 will be out in October. This replaces Windows Vista... blah, blah, blah</blockquote>
<p>&lt;/p&gt;It really is a different world, because I didnâ€™t know or care about that in the slightest compared to the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=wwdc+2009+keynote">other news today</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
