I"a<p>Today was a frustrating day as Citrix kept messing me around. I found that if I ran Windows in a VMWare on my Mac, the client there ran much better. The only problem was finding the Windows client. So I've got an <code>.ica</code> file, you need to run. So you end up at the following page, where next?</p>
<p>One easy place? Yeah right, it's not obvious or easy. Answer it's <i>Citrix XenApp (the new name for Presentation Server)</i>. As someone who doesn't know what all the product names mean, there's no way for me to know what the hell to do next.</p>
