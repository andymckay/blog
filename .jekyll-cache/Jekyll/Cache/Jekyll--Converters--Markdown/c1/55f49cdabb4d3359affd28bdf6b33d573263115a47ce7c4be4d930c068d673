<p>Thinking about <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/11/28/your-winnings-sir/">Jon Udell</a> having a higher Google ranking than Jon Stewart (which I just helped) I checked how Andy is doing these days. Sadly I don't figure at all in the ranking for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=andy">Andy</a>, I think a few years ago I got on the front page.</p>
<p>But I've always been able to hold down <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=andy+mckay">Andy McKay</a> top spot. Although there's some good prof's out there giving me good battering. But now I'm being beaten by Andy <b>MacKay</b>, because Google is being smart and inserting an extra a in there.</p>
<p>He's a worthy winner and it's going to take a bit to knock him off. But now I have to compete against McKay and MacKay's hey that's not fair. Fortunately it doesn't really matter that much :).</p>
