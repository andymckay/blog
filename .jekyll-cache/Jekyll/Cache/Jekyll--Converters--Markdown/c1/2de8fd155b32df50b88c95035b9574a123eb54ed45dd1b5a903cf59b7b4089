<blockquote>There are many programming fads, language fads, framework fads, design fads, architecture fads, management fads and project management fads. Guess what. None of them matter unless they get the job done. So, pay attention to them, because sometimes they have useful aspects, but don't let them take over how you do things. There are no silver bullets.</blockquote>
