I"ö<p>So youâ€™ve got some code you want reviewed? Awesome. But thereâ€™s a problem with
code reviews - <em>they can be disruptive to the person doing the review</em>.</p>

<p>The reviewer will be interrupting their own development and thought streams, a
review can be quite disruptive. As that reviewer is taking their time
to make your code better, they are doing you a favour, show them the respect
of getting a good pull request in.</p>

<p>The best way to help them and yourself is to make your code review easy to
read. Hereâ€™s some tips on that.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Follow your projects code writing guidelines, unless they are silly.</li>
  <li>Keep them small. A small pull request is easy to understand, review and get
feedback on. The difficulty of reviewing a pull request snowballs quickly
as it gets bigger.</li>
  <li>Try and keep a pull request to one concept or change at a time.</li>
  <li>Comment sensibly. Comments help people who read your code. Funny that.</li>
  <li>Review your change before you ask for a pull request. Youâ€™ll catch a few
errors in there (well I do).</li>
  <li>Make sure youâ€™ve got a link to the bug if the code review is for a bug.</li>
  <li>Readability of code counts. Small compact complicated code might be clever,
but making it hard to read makes it hard to review.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t skimp on the description. You can include multiple bullet points
of text explaining what is going on.</li>
  <li>If your result is visual, include an image in the pull request showing the
change. Weâ€™ve even had some people include videos, which is pretty cool.</li>
  <li>Once people start reviewing, follow up quickly if possible, so that you can
have that conversation whilst its in the other personâ€™s mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally - be mindful of other peoples time, they might have a whole pile of
other more important things to do.</p>

<p>And remember code reviews are an async process. Push your code review on to
the stack and then get on with something else. Donâ€™t get blocked on waiting.</p>
