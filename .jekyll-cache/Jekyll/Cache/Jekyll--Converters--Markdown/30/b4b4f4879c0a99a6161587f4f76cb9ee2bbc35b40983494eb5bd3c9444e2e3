I"Ù<p>We&#39;ve formed a new user group in the north west of england here called Norweb. We tried to broaden it beyond just Zope and Plone this time: <a href="http://norweb.cnuk.org/about/" target="_blank">About</a>.</p>
<p>The first talk is next week and is on Django:</p>
<blockquote> For the past few weeks Andy has been dabbling in Django which advertises itself as a &quot;Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines&quot;. Andy will present an intro to Django, hopefully some of the basic apps he&rsquo;s written will work for a demo and he will tell everyone why he thinks it&#39;s better than Ruby on Rails. </blockquote>
