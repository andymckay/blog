I"µ<p>From about Feb-April I didn't have a huge amount of consulting work. Then it's all come at once in one big heap. Happy to do it, but I would prefer it if it was a little bit more spread out so I could enjoy the long weekend a bit more.</p>
<p>Some news:</p>
<ul>
<li>New house rocks, been in it for a couple of weeks and couldn't be happier with it.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2699615/">Seattle Django user group</a> has started up from a few Plone friends.</li>
<li>EuroDjangoCon came and went without me being there, boo!</li>
<li><a href="http://tr.im/kQfC">Vancouver Plone User Group</a> is happening <s>tonight</s> tomorrow  (May 20th), come on by.</li>
</ul>
