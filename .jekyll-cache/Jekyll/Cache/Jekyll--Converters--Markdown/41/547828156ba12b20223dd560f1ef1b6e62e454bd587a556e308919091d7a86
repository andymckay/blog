I"™<p>Last week a new version of Clouseau came out that fixes issues that occurred with using Clouseau with buildout, namely a locals directory didn't exist and users didn't have permissions to save to the local directory. These should both be fixed and hopefully the python setup.py incantation worked so it's on Pypi correctly.</p>
