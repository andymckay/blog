I"<p>My MacBook has been getting more and more sluggish. One of the things that has been cropping up is a large amount of time spent by spotlight, seemingly indexing content - in top the <em>mds</em> process has been taking too long. Just so I remember in the <strong>comments</strong> of <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050504012104186">this article</a> is how to turn Spotlight off, don’t follow the process in the article.</p>

<p>Let’s see if that and the 2 gig of RAM on it’s way help.</p>
