I"§<p>In the past for camping Iâ€™ve used a primus stove like this one.</p>

<p>It need a pot, a pot handle and a fuel canister. It was better for cooking than some of the other stoves we had, but it has some problems. The flames arenâ€™t very focused, tending to go up the side and it needs a lot of fuel. Fuel is heavy.</p>

<p>For my West Coast Trail trip I was determined to be lightweight, that means the only food I took was dehydrated. Fresh water is in abundance on the West Coast Trail and I realised all I was ever doing was boiling water, I donâ€™t need pots or pans. I wonâ€™t be cooking for frying anything.</p>

<p>Enter the Jetboil:</p>

<p>I used the Jetboil on the West Coast Trail and loved it for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It boils really fast.</li>
  <li>The colour coding on the side tells you when its boiled.</li>
  <li>When its boiled, you donâ€™t need to fiddle with pans or pan handles, the cover allows you to pick it up and pour. Itâ€™s just really easy to use.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s really light.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s efficient which means you can carry less fuel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just for the fuel alone, using the Jetboil meant I could carry one 200g tank of fuel for 5 days of hiking. I would normally carry one <strong>large</strong> fuel tank, at least 500g+ (havenâ€™t got a full one to weigh). Because the old stove is that inefficient.</p>

<p>I was able to carry less and lighter, saving myself carrying multiple items and at least 500g. Over half the people on the trail, if not more, had a Jetboil or similar system.</p>
