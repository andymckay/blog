I"¤<p>We are in a climate crisis and yet we live in a city that prioritises cars. All the over the place. Just to be clear, North Vancouver is way better off than many other parts of the country, but weâ€™ve got some serious improvements we can make.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m hoping to do a serious of blog posts highlighting what itâ€™s like to cycle in North Vancouver - not as a mountain biker or a road biker - but as someone who wants to go about day to day jobs. Shopping. Taking the kids to school. Working. Visiting friends. Normal stuff.</p>

<p>For a start Iâ€™m going to focus on the four shopping our tourist areas east of the Seymour river. Deep Cove, Parkgate, Dollarton and Maplewood flats area.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to cycle your bike whats it like when you get there?</p>

<p>Just a disclaimer: Iâ€™m a cyclist and want to advance the cause of cycling. When you think how much public land is devoted to private property (cars) and storage of private property (cars) itâ€™s pretty mind boggling. Since cycling is better for the someones health, the community, and the environment I think its scandalous that we donâ€™t support cycling more.</p>
