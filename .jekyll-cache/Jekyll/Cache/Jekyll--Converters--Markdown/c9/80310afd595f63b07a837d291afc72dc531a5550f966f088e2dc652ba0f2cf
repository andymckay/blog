Well Rogers is going to be screwing the Canadian's royally that's for sure. The details <a href="http://micro.newswire.ca/release.cgi?rkey=1606278442&amp;view=5804-0&amp;Start=0">are here</a> for the new iPhone plans. But a quick precis.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A three year mandatory contract. Yes three years, twice as long as O2, 1 year longer than AT&amp;T.</li>
<li>The top plan $115 a month (about 57 pounds or 133 US dollars) gets you 800 minutes daytime, unlimited evening and weeknds and 2gb of data.</li>
<li>For an extra $20 a month you get "Caller ID, Who Called, Caller Ring Trax" and evenings starting at 6pm (apparently its normally <b>9pm</b>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow so that's a monthly cost $135 + $6.95 (system access fee) + 13% (plus GST and PST) = $5,776.56 in monthly fees over 3 years. Let's compare this to some other countries:</p>

<p>The most expensive Canadian plan is outshone by the third most expensive O2 plan (<a href="http://www.o2.co.uk/iphone/paymonthly">source</a>) and the cheapest AT+T plan (<a href="http://www.iphonehacks.com/2008/06/iphone-3g-att.html">source</a>). Yes I'm assuming unlimited data is the most important.</p>
<p>Shame on Rogers and shame on Apple, who know damn well what the costs were going to be. I can only hope the sales are dismal and instead in 6 months time Rogers loosen up or competition comes into the market place.</p> 
<p><b>Update:</b> &lt;a href="http://fuckyourogers.com/&gt;This site says it all&lt;/a&gt;.</p>
