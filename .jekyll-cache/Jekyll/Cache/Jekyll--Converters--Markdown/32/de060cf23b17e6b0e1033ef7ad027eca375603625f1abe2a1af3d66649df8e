I"O<p>It would be nice to start getting regular Python user group meetings going again, so I've set one up for May 18th, 7pm at the &lt;a href=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/about/contact.html""&gt;Mozilla Vancouver&lt;/a&gt; offices.</p>
<p>We don't have a speaker this time around, but that's cool we'll be borrowing the format from the Vancouver Django meetup - an informal round table chat - 5-10 minutes person to ask questions, show something off or bitch about the Canucks.</p>
<p>Wiki page has <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/VanPyZ">been updated</a>, hope to see you all there.</p>
