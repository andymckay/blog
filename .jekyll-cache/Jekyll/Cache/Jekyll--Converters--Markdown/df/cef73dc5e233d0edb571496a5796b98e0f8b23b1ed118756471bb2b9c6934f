I"‘<p>We got Tesco DVD Rental service a couple of weeks ago. It&#39;s a post you the DVD service, with a 2 week free trial. We rented 3 DVD&#39;s, two of them were unwatchable. The last had a big crack in it. This means the entire service is rather useless if only 66% of the DVD&#39;s are unwatchable.</p>
<p>To Tesco&#39;s credit, I found out that even though we could return the last DVD as soon as possible, we would be out of our free trail by one day and hence pay a full month fee for cancelling. I complained, our 2 week trial was extended and once past the 3 &quot;are you sure&quot; screens, the service was cancelled.</p>
<p>After reading around for another service I&#39;m now a little disillusioned. All the users of the services complain of one thing, never being able to get anything popular or new. The problem is simple, its a DVD store. Only it&#39;s got 1,000,000 subscribers and say 1,000 copies of that new DVD. If 50% of the people ask for it, who get&#39;s it?. From what I can gather, it&#39;s useless if you want to watch new movies. We generally don&#39;t worry about that, so we might go ahead with a different provider and see how it goes.</p>
