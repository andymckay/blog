I"ã	<p>It seems to be a common theme in elections for the incumbent party to ask the question, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EvFQLhqWPQ">Are you better off?</a>‚Äù. The Conservatives have been in power now since the 2006 election.</p>

<p>Financially? I‚Äôm better off, due to having a decent paying job in <a href="http://mozilla.org">a company</a> not based in Canada. The economy is moving along despite a Conservative running multiple deficits in a row. Really, I don‚Äôt place too much faith in the Government to do a huge amount to the economy, no matter what the Conservative attack adverts say.</p>

<p>Privacy? Much worse off, the Government have introduced multiple bills to reduce our privacy, none worse than bill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-terrorism_Act,_2015">C-51</a> which greatly increases the Government spying powers and reduces the amount of oversight.</p>

<p>Rights? Much worse off, the Government introduced bill <a href="https://bccla.org/2015/06/its-official-second-class-citizenship-goes-into-effect/">C-24</a> which means that the citizenship of me (and most of my friends and colleagues) can now be revoked. We are all second class citizens and not ‚Äú<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/old-stock-canadians-stephen-harper-identity-politics-1.3234386">old stock canadians</a>‚Äù. The reduction of our charter of rights and freedoms is breathtaking.</p>

<p>Environment? We are the only country in the world to withdraw from Kyoto and become <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2009/nov/30/canada-tar-sands-copenhagen-climate-deal">isolated Canada</a> on the world stage. There‚Äôs the oil sands turning Alberta into Mordor, there‚Äôs been major oil spills, the tragic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lac-M%C3%A9gantic_rail_disaster">Lac-M√©gantic</a> incident, the proposed pipelines and so on. And of course <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawas-new-anti-terrorism-strategy-lists-eco-extremists-as-threats/article533522/">environmentalists are terrorists</a>.</p>

<p>Science? The census was <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/vanishing-canada-why-were-all-losers-in-ottawas-war-on-data/">gutted</a> and decisions are not made on data, but ideology.</p>

<p>Right now? I am worse off. I have much less security and privacy than before. So no, I won‚Äôt be voting Conservative and I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would.</p>
