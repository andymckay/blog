I"Ë<p>Attended a talk at <a href="http://cmprofessionals.org/">cmprofessionals.org</a> last night. Who knew there was such an organisation, and they might be in your city. Apparently they have been going for about a year and talk every couple of months, so Iâ€™ll hopefully be going again. Itâ€™s a different group from the Python or Plone groups, I naturally sat down and got out my laptop to take notesâ€¦. only one there with a laptop.</p>

<p>The talk was on the <a href="http://vancouver2010.com">Vancouver 2010</a> website. Itâ€™s built using <a href="http://thelevel.com">The Level</a>â€™s software. They are a content management start up in Vancouver. Itâ€™s rumoured their main contract is a big project for Google (was confirmed last night that they do something for them).</p>

<p>Before the Torino cames they had to get the content out of the old web site and get a new site up and running with a new design in the new CMS. The organising committee (Vanoc) has got their sponsor Bell Canada to do the site which then used The Level. There was a team of 6 people building the site over 3 months, with 3 content editors plugging in the content. Thereâ€™s probably many more involved in the auxilary, but that seemed to be the core group.</p>

<p>The lady doing the talking (whoâ€™s name unfortunately I did not write down), showed us a demo of editing content. Being one of the few techy people in the audience I was curious to get a quick preview of the editing interface. Basically itâ€™s an in place editing system, most of the template is fixed with a few areas you can edit. Common to editing systems a little button pops up so you can edit the post, which takes you to a new page. That pages is just like a Plone edit page, but out of contextâ€¦ enter the data in a few fields and the text into a simple wysiwyg editor.</p>

<p>From a few comments made it seems clear that the system has some sort of relational or xml database backend. Content is pulled out and transformed on the way using XSLT. Spotted a few things in there like versioning and staging but nothing really stunning. Ah Iâ€™m such a cynic, but câ€™mon I thing automatic RSS feeds, css for mobile users and so on are standard these days (although Iâ€™m sure people say similar things about Plone with different topics).</p>

<p>My two questions: localisation and accessibility were answered deftly. They even did focus groups for accessiblity prior to launch, good for them! Didnâ€™t get into specifics about the traffic, would be curious. From here the site is fast and I can imagine during Turino there was quite a peak of interest. A quick ab gave me:</p>

<p>Requests per second:    22.73 [#/sec] (mean)</p>

<p>However I did it for 50 requests and got a server timeout. Eek, better not run benchmarks on other peopleâ€™s servers :)</p>

<p>Moving to the games is going to be an interesting transition, the site needs for getting all the data from the games out is a different challenge, something Iâ€™d like to see more talks on.</p>
