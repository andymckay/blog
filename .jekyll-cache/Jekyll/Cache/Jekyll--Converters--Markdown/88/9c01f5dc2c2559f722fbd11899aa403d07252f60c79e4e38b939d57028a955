I"u<p>The Ride to Conquer Cancer is a fund raising event by the <a href="http://bccancerfoundation.com/">BC Cancer Foundation</a>. Each year thousands of riders go from Vancouver down to Seattle in the US and over the years has raised millions of dollars.</p>

<p>This year the <a href="http://www.conquercancer.ca/goto/mozilla">Mozilla Vancouver has put together a team</a>. Myself, <a href="http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Ride/Vancouver2017?px=4189838&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1593">Roland Tanglao</a> and <a href="http://www.conquercancer.ca/site/TR/Ride/Vancouver2017?px=4242971&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1593">Eva Szekely</a> from the Vancouver Mozilla office will be riding and raising money. If you’d like to support our cause, then please <a href="http://www.conquercancer.ca/goto/mozilla">consider donating</a>. We’ve got a fundraising goal and we are going to make it.</p>

<p>I attended the <a href="https://mckay.pub/2016-08-29-luxury/">ride last year</a> and found it moving to see so many people working to help a cause. This year I’m riding for family and friends who have been affected with cancer, but specifically for <a href="https://mckay.pub/2016-01-25-robbie-burns/">my father</a> who passed away a few years ago.</p>

<p>If any Mozillians from the wider Mozilla community in Vancouver want to join in, please <a href="mailto:andy@mckay.pub">drop me a line</a>.</p>
