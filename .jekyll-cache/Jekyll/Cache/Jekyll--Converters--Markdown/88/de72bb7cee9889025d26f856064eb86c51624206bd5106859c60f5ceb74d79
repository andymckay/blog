I"<p>Unfortunately I'm not going to get time to work on DjangoSki this year. With the change in employment and other things that have happened, I've just got too many things on. This is the crucial time I need to be doing all the work, getting keynotes and figuring out locations, financing and the like. This timing is especially crucial with the possible ski season dates.</p>

<p>Sorry about that.</p>

<p>I will be continuing to do Django and go skiing, probably on the same day. Hopefully we can go for DjangoSki 2012.</p>
