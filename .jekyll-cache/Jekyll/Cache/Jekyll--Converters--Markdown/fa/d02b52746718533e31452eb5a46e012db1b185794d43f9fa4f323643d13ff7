I"†<p>Checking in with my <a href="https://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/">five month goals</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Holy crap itâ€™s been this long.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lost a couple of pounds and finally got back on track with my diet. Not as good as it could be, but getting better.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Still stuggle with eating too much after exercise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Iâ€™m doing a lot of exercise and Iâ€™m back cycling now, yay! Did 127 km bike ride followed by an 80 km bike ride this weekend for example. Yeah I was tired.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Still running a couple of days a week around 5km ish. Need to bring that back up to 8 and 10km and still keep cycling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I havenâ€™t been to the gym in ages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
