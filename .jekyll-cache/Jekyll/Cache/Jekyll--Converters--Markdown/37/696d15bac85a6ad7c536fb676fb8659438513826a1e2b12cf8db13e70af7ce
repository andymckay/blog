I"ö<p>Iâ€™ve been a big fan of <a href="https://www.tangerine.ca">Tangerine</a> for a while, itâ€™s a bank that doesnâ€™t charge fees and does what I need to do. They used to have a great app and website and then it all went a bit wrong.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s now a HTML app for Desktop and mobile. This isnâ€™t the fault of the tools used, but thereâ€™s some terrible choices in the app across both.</p>

<h3 id="notifications">Notifications</h3>

<p>On my phone I get the notification number on my app screen. So, I open up the app and I get this little message:</p>

<p><img src="/files/tangerine-notifications.png" /></p>

<p>But, you canâ€™t click on it. Itâ€™s not a link, to find your notifications you have to go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Profile &amp; Settings</code>, scroll down to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Inbox</code> and then you can access the notifications. If notifications that are that important, how about you put a way to access them somewhere obvious.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a notification:</p>

<p><img src="/files/tangerine-nan.png" /></p>

<h3 id="space">Space</h3>

<p>When you open the app, a full 1/3 of the screen is an advert:</p>

<p><img src="/files/tangerine-insights.png" /></p>

<p>Letâ€™s dismiss that:</p>

<p><img src="/files/tangerine-dismiss.png" /></p>

<p>Oh come on Tangerine. Iâ€™m not logging into my phone to get â€œInsightsâ€, otherwise known as â€œAdvertisingâ€. Stop taking up space with this crap.</p>

<h3 id="cancelling">Cancelling</h3>

<p>Pop quiz. You are cancelling this transaction. What does the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cancel</code> button do?</p>

<p><img src="/files/tangerine-cancel.png" /></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cancel</code> button cancels the cancelling. The highlighted option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Confirm</code> actually continues the cancelling. You know what would be clearer? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yes</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">No</code>.</p>

<h3 id="cluttered">Cluttered</h3>

<p>Supposing I wanted to see my transactions on an account. Thereâ€™s about one half of the screen to scroll down. The black text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Posted Transactions</code> doesnâ€™t actually do anything. The transaction list is an infinite scroll. So instead theyâ€™ve put everything at the top of the page, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Search</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transaction Breakdown</code> and so on.</p>

<p><img src="/files/tangerine-transactions.png" /></p>

<p>Then thereâ€™s another title <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transactions</code>. Do you get the idea that in those 5 boxes saying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transactions</code>, this might be aboutâ€¦</p>

<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>

<p>The overall feel of the app is that its full of spinners, far too cluttered and just to confusing. Hey not everything Iâ€™ve built is perfect, but even I can spot some real problems with this app. I pretty sure Tangerine can do better than this.</p>

<p>And yes, Iâ€™m writing this while drinking a beer I recently bought, as shown on my transaction page.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d still recommend Tangerine and their credit card. If you want to open an account, use my key: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20790922S1</code> to give get yourself a bonus.</p>
