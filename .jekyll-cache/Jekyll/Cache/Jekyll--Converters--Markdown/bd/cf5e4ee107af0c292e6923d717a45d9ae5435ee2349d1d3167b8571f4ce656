I"<p>Good job here caring about accessiblity. A Google Chart is an image grabbed from the Google cloud, not very accessible if you can't see the chart. <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2008/01/08/generating-charts-from-accessible-data-tables-using-the-google-charts-api/">This converts</a> the table into a URL the chart API likes. This is probably much easier for developers as well who can instantly get their head around a HTML table.
