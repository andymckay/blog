I"·<p>For the longest time Iâ€™ve used vertical tabs in Firefox and I still find it odd that people donâ€™t use it more. Itâ€™s a simple fact that a horizontal tab strip doesnâ€™t scale too well when you get lots of tabs.</p>

<p>Of course, for most users this isnâ€™t a problem, most users do not have a lot of tabs open according to <a href="https://telemetry.mozilla.org/new-pipeline/dist.html#!cumulative=0&amp;end_date=2018-02-08&amp;keys=__none__!__none__!__none__&amp;max_channel_version=nightly%252F60&amp;measure=TAB_COUNT&amp;min_channel_version=null&amp;processType=*&amp;product=Firefox&amp;sanitize=1&amp;sort_keys=submissions&amp;start_date=2018-01-22&amp;table=0&amp;trim=1&amp;use_submission_date=0">Firefox telemetry</a>:</p>

<p>But if you have a few the title just gets squished and squished till it becomes a scroll bar. Vertical tabs look great for this giving you lots of title space on a wide monitor:</p>

<p>Firefox is <em>way better</em> at this than Chrome. I sat next to someone who had nothing but triangles as their tab bar in Chrome. How did they cope?</p>

<p>With the landing of the tab hiding API in WebExtensions in Firefox 59, I wanted to try and understand what the many people who were clamouring for this API wanted to do. So I wrote a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-hider/">quick extension thatâ€™s pretty terrible</a>. It provided a â€œHide this tabâ€ context menu item on the tab to hide the tab. I then added a quick management page to list all the hidden pages.</p>

<p><img src="/files/tab-hidden-list.png" /></p>

<p>That was ok, but clicking that menu item was tedious. So then I set it to just perform some actions for me. Iâ€™ve now got it set up to <em>hide</em> a tab if it hasnâ€™t been looked it for an hour. Then five hours after that, if I havenâ€™t opened it again, the extension just closes the tab.</p>

<p>I tried that for a week and found it pretty useful. Tabs that are hidden still show up in the awesome bar and as soon as I click on them, they come back instantly. Eventually theyâ€™ll get closed. Theyâ€™ll still appear in the awesome bar and I can bring them back, just in a slower manner.</p>

<p>If I find myself saying â€œwhere was that tabâ€¦â€ I just go to the management view and its likely there.</p>

<p>This extension isnâ€™t perfect, but its enabled me to stop using vertical tabs most of the time and now Iâ€™m torn which workflow is better. Maybe some combination.</p>
