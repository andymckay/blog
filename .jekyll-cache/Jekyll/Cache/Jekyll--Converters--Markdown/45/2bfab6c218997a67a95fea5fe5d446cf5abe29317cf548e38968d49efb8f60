I"º<p>Had to change a light bulb in my Avensis headlight. A Google for it returned no instructions just horror stories. After a couple of motorway trips through the dark and rain, I decided it was time to fix it (besides it's technically illegal).</p>
<p>For about 10 minutes I struggled to get the clip off the bulb. The manual promises a simple future of things that easily popup with easy access. The reality was quite different. Ten minutes in she offered help.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes the clip was off the bulb out, the new bulb in, clip set and the really hard part (according to the websites) was done before I'd said "And this was meant to be really hard...". Thank god she was there.</p>
