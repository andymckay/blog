I"·<p>Last year I had the luck to meet some old friends from university. For quite a while the last two years  I seemed to spend a large amount of time sat in front of a car steering wheel or a computer monitor.</p>
<p>So one of my resolutions this year is to spend more time with friends. Plus spending more time catching up with old friends. I think that's important. So if you have just been added to my facebook or twitter - lookout.</p>
