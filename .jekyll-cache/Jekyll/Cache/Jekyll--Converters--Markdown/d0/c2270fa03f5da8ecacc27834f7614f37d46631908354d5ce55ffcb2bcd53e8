I"¾<p>It's region encoded. Dammit why didn't I check that. Meaning if we moved back to Canada we'd have to buy a new Wii to play games bought in Canada. I've currently got 3 Canadian DVD players (computers), 2 Uk DVD players (one computer, one actual DVD console). And now 1 English only Wii. Perhaps if I move I'll be selling the Wii and buying something else. Very annoyed Nintendo would do this to me. Even more annoyed I didn't check first.</p>
