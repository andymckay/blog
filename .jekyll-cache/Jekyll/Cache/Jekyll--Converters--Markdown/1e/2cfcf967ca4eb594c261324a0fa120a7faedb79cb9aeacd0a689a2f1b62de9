I"&<p>I started running before the pandemic was upon us and built up to my first big race, the Vancouver BMO Marathon, which I did as a <a href="https://mckay.pub/2019-05-13-four-months-in/">half marathon in 2019</a>. I registered for 2020 and then everything went wrong.</p>

<p>The training group ended and everything stopped and I never really completed the <a href="https://twitter.com/eLLiejG/">training plan that Ellie</a> had built out. Then my friends said, letâ€™s do a pandemic marathon on our own, so we got to some sort of training going again and then tried it in <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/3714625581">Chilliwack</a>. At 30km I re-aggravated an injury and had to walk it out painfully. I wouldnâ€™t call this a success.</p>

<p>Then in 2021, my friends and I sort of stuck to the marathon training and did the BMO route, 2 of us for 21km then we had 3 for the last 21km. I ended up at 5h 8min for my <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/5264101193">first complete marathon</a>, but at the end I was running and walking as I struggled.</p>

<p>This year was my first marathon in front of a crowd, with many other runners and an official time ðŸŽ‰. The first 21km was pretty easy going and I felt confident that I could get under 5 hours, which was my target. The next 10km were ok. The last 11km or so were not as the heat and just general fatigue really started to get me.</p>

<p>Again, as I passed Siwash rock and passed 36km, I was walking and running. I was still keeping up with the crowd and making sure that the 5hr pace runner stayed behind me. It was painful but I was determined to finish and I did in 4h 51m.</p>

<p>As I came across the finish line I almost puked and fortunately a volunteer was right there with a bag. I didnâ€™t puke, but that was hard. I still am not able to hit an average pace. Turns out Iâ€™m an above average cyclist and a below average runner. Oh well.</p>
