I"ó<p>You can now get fuzzy date times such as 2 hours or 10 minutes (from Trac) in JSONP by hitting clearwind-labs. For example: <a href="http://clearwind-labs.appspot.com/fuzzydate?start=2008-10-06%2012:32:52">http://clearwind-labs.appspot.com/fuzzydate?start=2008-10-06%2012:32:52</a>.</p>
<p>Normalize is the Plone code for normalizing id's available as JSONP too: <a href="http://clearwind-labs.appspot.com/normalize?text=sterreich%20has%20GREAT%20beer">http://clearwind-labs.appspot.com/normalize?text=sterreich%20has%20GREAT%20beer</a>
<p>These are over at <a href="http://clearwind-labs.appspot.com/">http://clearwind-labs.appspot.com/</a>.</p>
<p>I could keep going on this theme for ages, must stop and get some useful stuff done instead.</p>
