I"<p>The new book <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/practical-plone-3-beginners-guide-to-building-powerful-websites/">Practical Plone 3: A Beginner's Guide to Building Powerful Websites</a> is out. Haven't read it, but it sounds like it fills an excellent need - beginners who need to know how to use Plone. If you are new to Plone, read this first and then <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/Professional-Plone-web-applications-CMS/book">Professional Plone Development</a> second.</p>
<p>Probably something I should go and read.</p>
