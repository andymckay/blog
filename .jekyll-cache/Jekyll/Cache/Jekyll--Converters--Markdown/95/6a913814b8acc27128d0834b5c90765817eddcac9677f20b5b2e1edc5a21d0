I"u<p>ClearRSS is an RSS news feed parser written in Ajax, that uses the AjaxProxy to pull RSS feeds from remote sites and display them in your site. This is a quick 0.1 release, I havenâ€™t tested it in IE but it worked for me in Firefox. Volunteers to get this to a 1.0 welcomed. RSS feeds are sped up dramatically by local Zope caching of them.</p>

<p>This follows on the Ajax Services theme. <em>Note</em>: that the RSS parsing code is actually re-used from another non-Plone project and then customised which is why it only took and hour to write.</p>
