I"é<p>The day the first edition of the Definitive Guide to Plone arrived, my brand new baby Emily was pictured with the book. Here she is at 5 with her sister Samantha holding the second edition. I can't claim any credit for the second book, it was all done by the fine people at Redomino.</p>
<p>I had a quick glance through and it looks really good, I hope it does well - <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/1430218932?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wwwzopezenorg-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=1430218932">Buy from Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>It's amazing to think what has happened in my life since that book came out and this picture sums it all up for me.</p>
