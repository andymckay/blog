I"„<p><img align="right" src="/files/naive-blog.png" />There is lots of blogging software out there for Plone and a lot of is very complicated. I donâ€™t need any of these things in a blog. I donâ€™t need custom skins or ui. I donâ€™t need a workflow. So all I really need is what NaiveBlog gives me. A content type thatâ€™s a copy of News Item and a smart folder that shows them.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s called NaiveBlog for a reason.</p>

<p>Download: <a href="/files/NaiveBlog.0.1.zip">NaiveBlog 0.1</a></p>

<p>Or alternatively just run the recipe in Clouseau: <a href="http://svn.clearwind.ca/public/plone/recipes/naive-blog.py">naive-blog.py</a></p>
