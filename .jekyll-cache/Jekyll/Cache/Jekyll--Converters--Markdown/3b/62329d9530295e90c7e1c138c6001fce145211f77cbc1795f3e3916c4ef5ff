I"k<p>At the recommendation of <a href="http://plone.org/author/calvinhp">Calvin</a>, I started watching Six Feet Under a while back. We haven't got through season one yet, since Blockbuster's postal movie system is now grinding to a crawl taking us days to get DVD's (oi wake up Blockbuster). But we have really enjoyed this show, it's great fun. Calvin formed <a href="http://www.sixfeetup.com/">Six Feet Up</a>, legend has it the name is related to the show.</p>
<p>Thanks Calvin, and if you haven't watched it, I recommend giving it a try.</p>
<p><b>Addendum:</b> as noted by a few people my original post had a fantastic typo "Sex Feet Under". The show is mostly about sex, must have had that on the brain. Calvin mailed me to say the name "Six Feet Up" was before the show and came from his <a href="http://www.sixfeetup.com/about-us/the-company">mother's family</a>.</p>
