I"Û<p>As it turns out Iâ€™m not very good at this whole political party thing. But if you were going to join a political party, you might want to read the fine print. For most, you are not allowed to join more than one. Which is annoying, my personal opinions donâ€™t fit nicely into a party. The prospect of being in more than one party could be interesting.</p>

<p>So I asked the parties why I canâ€™t join more than one and after several months I got a couple of answers by email.</p>

<blockquote>The reason we ask that you not retain other memberships in other provincial or federal partyâ€™s is because as a member of the NDP you may be privy to sensitive information about both donors, member details and election planning.</blockquote>
<p><cite>BC NDP party</cite></p>

<blockquote>It is a party constitutional requirement.</blockquote>
<p><cite>BC Liberal party</cite></p>

<p>Federally this is also true for the liberals (<a href="http://convention.liberal.ca/files/2011/12/LPC-2009-Constitution-EN-revised-June-18-2011.pdf">PDF</a>), <a href="https://www.greenparty.ca/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=1&amp;source=NC.W.UH">Green party</a> and <a href="https://secure.ndp.ca/membership_declaration.html">NDP</a>.</p>

<p>But not for the <a href="https://secure.conservative.ca/donation.aspx?cmp=ml&amp;lang=en">federal Conservatives</a> and <a href="https://secure.bcconservative.ca/?f=membership">BC Conservatives</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently the numbers of people actually in political parties are quite small. A similar problem exists in the UK where numbers have been falling over the years. In Canada:</p>

<blockquote>Of the eight to ten per cent of Canadians who were engaged more robustly in election campaigns, only about 1-2% per cent were consistently active members of a party, placing Canada at the bottom of the list of Western democracies.</blockquote>
