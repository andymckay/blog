I"ø<p>A few years ago we did the <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/images?q=bowron%20lakes">Bowron Lakes</a> in canoes. It was one of the most wonderful holiday's I've had. I've never been so relaxed. It was a 9 day canoe trip in one of the most beautiful places on earth (shame none of the photos are scanned in, before our digital SLR).</p>
<p>This year I'm taking the opportunity of being in the UK to do the <a href="http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/PennineWay/">Pennine Way</a> with my father. The Pennine Way is a long walk from Edale near Manchester up to the Scottish border. 250 odd miles (depending upon the exact route) over 20 days. We can't take 20 days in a row, my father at 65+ could do it. But for me it will take some breaking in for me to get that far. So we are breaking it down into day and weekend trips.</p>
<p>We'll try and do it in order, so should be setting off from Edale in a few weeks and giving a shorter walk a try. So now I've got an excuse to buy some new GPS and walking toys... </p>
