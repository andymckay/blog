<p>So there's a contract right?</p>

<p>Wait, what?</p>
<p>I've always thought politicians need to credited for doing u-turns (e.g. not invading Iraq). But the Auditor General report has slammed the Canadian military procurement process, but all that does is provide a scapegoat for the Government. The Government has messed this up by having a ridiculous procurement process, ignoring all signs of the F-35 going wrong and then turned around and dumped the blame on the military - so the Government can have <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/tories-boost-oversight-but-heads-wont-roll-on-f-35-purchase/article2390596/">more control</a>.</p>
<p>But, on the contract issue, stating we have a contract, then "obviously we don't". Some would say <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/video/video-rae-calls-for-pms-resignation-over-fighter-jets/article2392190/">that's lying</a>.</p>
<p>At least we have a chance of not getting the F-35s and spending our budget more wisely <a href="https://mckay.pub/blog/andy/2296/">on alternatives</a>. But clearly, it won't be the best one, so we'll be lumbering our troops with the second best.</p>
