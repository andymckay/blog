I"õ<p>When I normally do a long ride, I get graphs that are kind of messy. The North Shore is notoriously hilly and so you get crazy graphs that show my heart rate and speed all over the place.</p>

<p>However, I live in Deep Cove and occasionally just go straight up Mount Seymour, back down and then collapse in a heap at my house. Iâ€™m not fast or fit, but Iâ€™m trying to get better.</p>

<p>This produces some satisfyingly nice graphs.</p>

<p>Elevation:</p>

<p>Then thereâ€™s speed (yeah, Iâ€™m not fast):</p>

<p><img src="/files/speed-seymour.png" /></p>

<p>And then the inverse, my heart rate (yeah, Iâ€™m not fit):</p>

<p><img src="/files/heart-rate-seymour.png" /></p>

<p>Most satisfying.</p>
