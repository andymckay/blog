I"è<p>Wow Cuil was a spectacular launch of a pretty average search engine that I'd never use again. It didn't respond very well to many searches, sometimes coming up blank for things that should work.</p>
<p>What was amazing was the level of attention they got. It was on every tech blog and all the news sites I read. Bloody good job getting that much attention though I've no idea why: so it's got ex-Googlers there or indexes billions of pages or is "pioneering". Whoopdee do. Haven't seen that much press since the iPhone 3G.</p>
