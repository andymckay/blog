I"m<p>I’ve set up <a href="http://www.clearwind.ca">ClearWind</a> to use Wordpress the same blogs database and code as this server. Which meant I had to start editing some PHP, ick. It turns out to be pretty straightforward, using the category I included all of one category in one blog and excluded all of a category in the other… the only problem being that now the RSS feeds include everything so have to filter ClearWind out of that, apologies if you follow my RSS feed.</p>

<p>The key bit of code for doing this was <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop#Exclude_Posts_From_Some_Category">this page</a>.</p>
