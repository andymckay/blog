I"î	<p>This week I recieved and email from the Clean Energy Vehicle program. Theyâ€™d like us to install a device in our Tesla that tracks us:</p>

<p>â€œBy understanding when and where EVs charge to how much energy is consumed, you can help pave the way for future drivers by ensuring that the power system is ready for a plug-in future.â€</p>

<p>The program details <a href="https://www.fleetcarma.com/chargebc/">are here</a>.</p>

<p>â€œGPS information is collected, but not shared at the individual level. The data is collected and stored but no one outside of FleetCarma will see an individualâ€™s location data.â€</p>

<p>Alright so whoâ€™s FleetCarma? Letâ€™s look into <a href="https://www.fleetcarma.com/chargebc/terms/">the terms</a>:</p>

<p>â€œData Collected by the C2 Device and Privacyâ€¦  drive start date and time, duration of trip, trip distanceâ€¦ GPS coordinates of the drive,â€</p>

<p>â€œWith the specific exclusion of GPS coordinates when driving, an anonymized subset of the data outlined above may be shared with the Province and BC Hydro and other third party suppliersâ€</p>

<p>â€œGPS coordinates during driving will not be shared with any Program partners or third party suppliers except in both anonymous and aggregate form to inhibit extraction of any individual driving behaviour.â€</p>

<p>Not sure who those Program partners or third party suppliers are but GeoTab uses <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sVygLN02w2xNovFY4q5vw-oAzfYxCd7WLhyToElgDbs/pub">some sub-processors</a>.</p>

<p>FletCarma will <a href="https://www.fleetcarma.com/privacy/">share your information</a>:</p>

<p>â€œTo affiliated entities of CrossChasm Technologies Inc., including wholly owned subsidiariesâ€ (Whomever that is)</p>

<p>â€œWhen weâ€™re legally required to provide data, such as in response to a subpoena in a civil lawsuit.â€</p>

<p>Itâ€™s nice to note.</p>

<p>â€œYou may also request that your Personal Information be deleted. FleetCarma will promptly respond to your request within 30 daysâ€</p>

<p>At this point I can surmise that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>FleetCarma will know all the trips I make in the car.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FleetCarma be subpoenad to give up that information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>FleetCarma can be hacked to give up all that information.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Normally this would be a simple, hell no. But I care greatly about electric cars and the infrastructure and this has put me in a bind. The privacy problem here is one that I simply canâ€™t get around.</p>
