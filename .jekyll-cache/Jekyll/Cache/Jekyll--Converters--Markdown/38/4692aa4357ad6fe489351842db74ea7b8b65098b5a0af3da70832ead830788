Clouseau 0.5 features a load and save ability. You can take your session that youâ€™ve spent 10 minutes and click â€œSaveâ€ to save it to your local file system. They can then they be loaded back in, returning you to your original state.</p>

<p>Just to make any security hole in Clouseau bigger, it can now load sessions from URLâ€™s. <em>Meaning you can have code on plone.org, or say paste.plone.org and automatically pull it into Clouseau</em>. Look for recipes about to appear soon.</p>
