I"Å<p>Tips for developing with Docker.</p>

<h2 id="write-critical-logs-outside-the-container">Write critical logs outside the container</h2>

<p>You are developing an app, so it will go wrong. It will go wrong a lot, that‚Äôs fine. But at the beginning you will have a cycle that goes like this: container starts up, container starts your app, app fails and exits, container stops. What went wrong with your app? You‚Äôve got no idea.</p>

<p>Because the container died, you lost the logs and if you start the container up again, the same thing happens.</p>

<p>If you store the critical logs of your app outside your container, then you can see the problems after it exits. If you use a process runner like  <a href="http://supervisord.org/">supervisord</a> then you‚Äôll find that <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#logs">docker logs</a> contains your process runner.</p>

<p>You can do a few things here, like move your logs into the process runner logs, or just write your logs to a location that allows you to save them. There‚Äôs lots of ways to do that, but since we use supervisord and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a>, for us its a matter of making sure supervisord writes its logs out to a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#volume">volume</a>.</p>
