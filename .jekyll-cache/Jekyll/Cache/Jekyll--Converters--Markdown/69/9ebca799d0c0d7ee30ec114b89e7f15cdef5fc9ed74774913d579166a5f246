I"¹<p>Weâ€™re planning a trip to Italy in October with the excuse that there is a Plone conference in Naples. So Andy has booked a week off work prior to the conference and we will end up with 10 days in and around Naples. We will fly to Rome, so will spend a few days there first, then travel down to Naples for the last 4 days (for the conference) or a bit longer. Not sure where to go or what to see in between, though. Any suggestions?</p>
