I"E<p>Well I landed a bit ago in England, but with Christmas and other stuff it wasn't slightly hectic to say the least. We still haven't got a spot to live yet, slumming it parents. There is a bit of insanity in England because everything revolves around either a credit check or a utility bill.</p>

<p>Yes the utility bill is the holy grail that unlocks everything. If you have that you can get a bank account. Rent a house. Probably get into Buckingham Palace. Oh without it .... "oh we can't give you a cell phone", "oh do you have a guarantor for that bank account", i've met more "More than job's worth" in the last few days than I can remember. Perhaps it's just the cheery English disposition. We have pay as you go phones and so on.</p>

<p>How's England? Well living here is different from visting on and off for 10 years. I forgot how expensive everything is here. It's partly converting everything in your head, you take everything and multiply it by the exchange rate and all of a sudden its expensive. I figure it will take a few months for me to stop doing that.</p>

<p>For all those who ask where I am, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ybowqm">its here</a>. North of Liverpool, where I work.</p>

<p>Next I've got to set up some sort of Google maps, Flickr, blog mash up. Or re-use someone else's, surely there's a good one out there.</p>
