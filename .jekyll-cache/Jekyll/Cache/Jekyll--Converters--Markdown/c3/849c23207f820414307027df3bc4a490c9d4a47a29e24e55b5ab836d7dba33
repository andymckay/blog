I"o<p>This morning we found our garage door forced open and lots of stuff gone missing. Of course most stuff was backed up offline, but the most distressing part is that the Time machine hard drive was taken. We might have lost about a year of photographs of our kids (the rest is backed up elsewhere). That's the hardest part to bear.</p>
<p>Anyway if you are trawling on craigslist or eBay and see some of these things, give us a yell. A Mac Pro and a Lacie hard drive should be pretty uncommon.</p>
