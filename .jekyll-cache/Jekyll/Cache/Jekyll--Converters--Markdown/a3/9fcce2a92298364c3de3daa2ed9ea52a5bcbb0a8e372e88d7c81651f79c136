I"\<p>From <a href="http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2007/01/02/the-dojo-offline-toolkit/" target="_blank">Brad Neuberg</a> the Dojo offline toolkit. &lt;blockquote&gt; Let’s look at the Dojo Offline Toolkit from a user’s perspective. Imagine Alex is using a web-based real estate application for realtors built with the Dojo Offline Toolkit. In the upper-right corner of this web application is a button that says "Work Offline." The first time Alex clicks on this button, a small window appears informing him that this web application can be accessed and used even if he is offline. &lt;/blockquote&gt; I've been rambling on about such a toolkit to anyone who'll listen to me the last few months and toying with tools to do just that. Of course I've produced nothing but ideas, hopefully someone who actually does things, like Brad, might produce something.</p>
