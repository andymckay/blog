<p>If you have a complex long-term application, it will be complex to set up. That means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>it gets harder to bring new developers on board</li>
  <li>it gets harder to add in new pieces</li>
  <li>bugs start to occur between different developers deployments</li>
  <li>setting up the application becomes handed down knowledge</li>
</ul>

<p>The worst thing is that you canâ€™t see the technical debt that is piling up. Itâ€™s underneath your application, but because you never set up your development environment again, you donâ€™t see it. You can stay productive, setting up the application is a rite of passage for other people.</p>

<p>Reduce the number of settings. Make it work well out of the box. Get as few steps as possible. Document it. Script it.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve got the rebuild happening quickly, you wonâ€™t fear setting up your application again.</p>
