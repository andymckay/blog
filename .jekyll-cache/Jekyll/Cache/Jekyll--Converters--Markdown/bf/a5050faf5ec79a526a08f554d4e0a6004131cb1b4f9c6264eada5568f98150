<p>So there I was in my friends kitchen on New Years Eve and I saw this on the fridge (cropped version of some form). I knew his wife played an extra in Season Four of Battlestar Galactica (looking forward to the 6th when its released on DVD). But then I found out he was an extra too.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah I played a civilian captain in some scene. Hung out with Six, Apollo, Starbuck and the director ... Adama is it? They were all cool, really nice." ... and I just thought damn that's cool. It's easy to get starstruck even at my ripe old age I guess.</p>
