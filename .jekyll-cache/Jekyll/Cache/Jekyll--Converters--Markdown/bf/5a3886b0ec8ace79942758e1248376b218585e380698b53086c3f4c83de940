I"j<p>There’s nothing quite like the Silicon Valley bubble. From the ridiculous salaries and treatment that developers get to the types of problems that people are trying to solve. Like getting limos to drive them around easier (<a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>) or tacos delivered by drones (<a href="http://tacocopter.com/">TacoCopter</a>). It’s hard to forget that the majority of the world does not live like this.</p>

Although that’s probably the smallest amount I’ve ever contributed to a project, it is still the one I’m proudest of. For a brief moment my technology was actually helping real people in clear and obvious ways.</p>

<p>I have to find a way to do more of this stuff.</p>
