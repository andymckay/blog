I"«<p>Checking in with my <a href="httsp://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/">two month goals</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lost a couple of pounds but keep going up and down.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diet has fallen completely and this is where I need to get back on track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running has improved again. The training runs are getting longer and longer. I did my longest run 11.2km and broke 30km a week twice.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I thought I did the West Van Run in 29 minutes last year. Turns out it was over 30 minutes. This year I came in 27.29, which puts me at a solid 5:30 pace. Faster than last time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gym work has picked up a little, mostly a chance to do long slow bike rides and focus on keeping my heart in zone 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Havenâ€™t had alcohol since 2018 even though Iâ€™ve been to some pubs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More to do, especially on the weight loss.</p>
