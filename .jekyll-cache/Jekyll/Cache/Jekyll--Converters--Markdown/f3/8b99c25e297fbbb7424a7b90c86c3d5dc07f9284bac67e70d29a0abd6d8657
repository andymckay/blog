I"Å<p>A bit ago was my fifth Gran Frondo, <a href="http://mckay.pub/2018-09-09-fourth-fondo/">the last</a> was in 2018.</p>

<p>Last year I dropped 25 minutes off my time and that made me really happy. This year my goal was 4 hours. This was just an aribtrary number, but it was also based on an attempt to qualify for the 2020 version of this race which is a UCI World Cup Event.</p>

<p>Up to May I was almost continually running with the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2344462557/overview">BMO Half Marathon</a> in May which I did in 2h 08m. In March, April and May I was running up to average of 40km a week.  I guess I was kind excited by that:</p>

<p>Because I focused a lot on running this year, my riding patterns changed a lot.</p>

<p>So in 2019, I spent less time on the bike. In fact I haven‚Äôt spent this little time on a bike since <strong>2015</strong>, which was my first year. After May I ran less frequently, but carried on running, varying between 0 (on bad weeks) to 30km (on good weeks).</p>

<p>I did <a href="http://mckay.pub/2018-05-27-mt-seymour/">Mount Seymour</a> at least 9 times (most yet) and broke my own personal record 4 times. I managed quite a few 100km plus rides: including the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2532536358">160km Penticton Gran Fondo</a> race, the challenge route of the <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2648420747">Ride to Conquer Cancer</a>, a ride up to Whistler, and a couple of trips to Golden Ears park.</p>

<p>Also this year I got a little more organised with my training. This is taped to my bedroom wall:</p>

<p><img src="http://mckay.pub/files/ED57AcSVUAEa5VC.jpg" /></p>

<p>This year I rode with Steed group 2 a few times, that‚Äôs the second fastest group and sometimes they go at a hell of a pace. Last year I stepped up from group 4 to group 3. Next year I aim to have group 2 as my default.</p>

<p>So the race came and as usual I spent a few days before hand excited and not sleeping too well. Yet again I hadn‚Äôt lost enough weight and I really doubted if the 4 hour figure was reasonable. Just thinking through what I did last year to get to 4:19 seemed daunting.</p>

<p>Again I started in the 4 to 4.5 corral which is essential to getting in with a good group. The first 30km was marred by several large and nasty looking crashes. I focused on going fast up to Squamish but needed to save something for later. As I passed my marker in Squamish I thought I was behind but honestly I didn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôd pushed myself too hard and felt fresh.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to me, I‚Äôd set personal records all the way and crushed it. My average was over 32km/h an hour at that point. To get close to 4 hours, my goal was to not let it drop below 30km/h. This year I couldn‚Äôt find good draughts in Squamish, the people were going too slow so I kept pulling out‚Ä¶ and as a result pulled an awful lot of people through Squamish.</p>

<p>I piled up the hills and again failed to find good draughts, despite thinking strategically and doing my best to line them up in the right places. About 25-30km out from Whistler I bonked again and realised I hadn‚Äôt been eating right. About 15km I was struggling hard and failing to keep up. My average km kept dropping and dropping. I was just pissed off and couldn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt go faster.</p>

<p>The result? <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2688389229">I ended up crossing at 4h 16m</a>. That‚Äôs 3 minutes faster - I was happy and sort of pissed off that I wasn‚Äôt faster. It‚Äôs my fastest ever time, I‚Äôve been faster every year so I‚Äôll take that.</p>

<p>Actually I guess I was pretty happy with it:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fuck yeah!

<p>I did not qualify for the World Cup race for next year, but I‚Äôve signed up again to do the normal race.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve signed up again and I‚Äôm going to crush 4 hours.</p>
