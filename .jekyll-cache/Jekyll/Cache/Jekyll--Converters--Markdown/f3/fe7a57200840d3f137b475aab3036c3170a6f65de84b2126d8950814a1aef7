I"±<p>Those of you who read about NFL football must have heard of <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/writers/dr_z/archive/#">Dr Z</a>., an excellent writer for Sports Illustrated. This week he had two strokes, Peter King says he's on the mend. He's a great writer and I look forward to him getting back to writing.</p>
<p>If you aren't a football fan and come here looking for something on Plone or Django, ignore this post.</p>
