This release has a few ui fixes and a few minor bug fixes. It comes with auto-complete. As you type away youâ€™ll see the auto complete below the prompt area. Clicking tab will auto-complete the text. Makes getting to those key elements very quick and easy.</p>

<p>Remember, installing DocFinderTab will give you more complete tool tips. This will make Clouseau feature complete, now we have to push to a 1.0 release with lots of bug fixes and cleanup.</p>
