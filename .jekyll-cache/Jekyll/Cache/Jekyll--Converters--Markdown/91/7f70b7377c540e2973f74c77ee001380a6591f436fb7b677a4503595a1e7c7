I"o<p>Checking in with my <a href="https://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/">one month goals</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lost 12 pounds. Although I did go as much as 15 pounds down, only to come back up again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diet was mostly Keto for a while, but I’ve slipped into some carbs for running and sometimes have too many carbs. That’s probably caused the lack of weight loss.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running has dramatically improved. At the beginning of the month I was feeling down because I was going slowly. This last week I completed <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2107454561">7.1k at a sub 6km/minute pace</a> and my training runs are getting faster.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Signed up for the West Van Run in March, want to beat my time on that from last year - 29 minutes - significantly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set a goal of doing a 10k in under an hour - that’s 5 minutes to chop off.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gym work has dropped off significantly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Haven’t had alcohol since 2018 even though I’ve been to some pubs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>More to do.</p>
