I"Ò	<p>And of course I canâ€™t go bike packing without a bike. Iâ€™ve got a Cervelo S3 disk, which is a fabulous and fast aero carbon fibre bike. But itâ€™s designed for races and sprinting. Itâ€™s high geared, canâ€™t take racks, isnâ€™t designed for comfort and I worry when I leave it locked up anywhere. I needed something more practical.</p>

<p>So I headed over <a href="https://landyachtzbikes.com/">Landyatchz</a>, an excellent bike shop on Adanac. They are one of the ones Iâ€™d trust in the lower mainland to work on a bike and also build custom frames.</p>

<p>What followed was repeated visits over a couple of months to try out their bikes and see what else was available. I really couldnâ€™t find much in other shops either, so two Landyatchz bikes became the favourite, the <a href="https://landyachtzbikes.com/shop/gravel/">aluminium AB1</a> or the <a href="https://landyachtzbikes.com/bike/cb-mkii-blue/">steel cb mkII<a>.</a></a></p>

<p>I actually wanted the latter, but to get one in my size would have meant waiting to August. Thanks supply chain. So Iâ€™ve got the aluminium AB1, in the newer colouring.</p>

<p>Nice gear range, but using SRAM Rival thereâ€™s only one gear on the front. Hydraulic disk brakes. Mount points absolutely everywhere. Itâ€™s a nice comfortable ride for long days in the saddle. Nice big fat tubeless tyres for off road bits.</p>

<p>Building out the custom build was fun, but again the supply chain problems that are ongoing meant that the choices were rather limited unfortunately.</p>

<p>Anyways Iâ€™m really happy with the bike and some 600km later itâ€™s done the job well, coping with gravel, road and everything Iâ€™ve thrown at it. The only two downsides so far is that I do wish the gear ratio went beyond 1:1. With all the bags on, it can be hard work getting up some of the bigger hills. Although I made it up everything that was paved.</p>

<p>I also would like tyres with less rolling resistance for the road. Thatâ€™s an easy fix and based on my (perhaps faulty) assumption that Iâ€™d be doing more gravel than tarmac.</p>
