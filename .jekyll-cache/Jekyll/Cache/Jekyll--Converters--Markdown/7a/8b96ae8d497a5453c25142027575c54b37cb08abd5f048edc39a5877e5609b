I"‘<p>My sleeping bags are optimized for what I started doing in my old age, camping now and again in the summer when its hot. If I barely needed a sleeping bag? Thatâ€™s the time to go camping.</p>

<p>Not so with the crazy bike packing trips I had in mind. I need something better.</p>

<p>By better it needed to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lightweight</li>
  <li>Pack down small</li>
  <li>Warm and cope with a couple of seasons</li>
</ul>

<p>I ended up with:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2467/2501/products/Spark-Ultralight-Sleeping-Bag-Side-View.jpg?crop=center&amp;height=1500&amp;v=1626820119&amp;width=1500" width="400" /></p>

<p>Its ultralight at 340g, made with ethically sourced down. It covers a couple of seasons of the year. It packs down really small and in my quick test seemed ultra warm.</p>

<p><strong>Current status:</strong> I havenâ€™t actually slept overnight in it yet.</p>
