<p>Last week we went on the Womens March in Vancouver. This was the <a href="http://mckay.pub/2015-04-07-harper/">second political</a> demonstration of my life.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s happening in the US with Trump is terrible and because the US is so large economically and politically itâ€™s having a huge reverberation around the world. Including Canada.</p>

<p>I want to send a message that itâ€™s not OK to Canadian politicians. That some of the people running for the Conservative Party of Canada that we wonâ€™t tolerate this kind of behaviour. That setting up a â€œ<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/02/canada-conservatives-barbaric-cultural-practices-hotline">barbaric cultural practices</a>â€ hotline is just capitalizing on racism. That screening for â€œ<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2016/09/08/kellie-leitchs-immigrant-screening-proposal-goading-rivals-to-debate-canadian-values.html">Canadian values</a>â€â€ is the opposite of Canadian values. That <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/federal-scientists-eager-to-share-their-research-now-that-muzzles-are-off/article27171269/">silencing scientists</a> is not something a free and open democracy shoud do.</p>

<p>Like many people I was just stunned when the US election was announced. I decided after that it was time to do something to stop anything like that happening in Canada. If we ever get to a point where the actual policies and truth donâ€™t matter, weâ€™ll be sliding down a horrible path. So I joined a political party and promised myself that I need to do more.</p>
