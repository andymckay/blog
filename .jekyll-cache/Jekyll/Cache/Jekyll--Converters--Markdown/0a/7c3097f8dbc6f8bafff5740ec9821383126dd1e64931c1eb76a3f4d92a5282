I"]<p>Checking in with my <a href="http://mckay.pub/2018-12-28-goals/">four month goals</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lost a couple of pounds but keep going up and down. Still struggling with this. My diet is still not good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Diet has fallen completely and this is where I need to get back on track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Running was amazing in April. We continually did longer and longer runs 14km, 16km, 18km, 19km, 21km runs. Only once when I decided to run the last 3km at 5:30 min/km pace did I feel totally exhausted after.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I haven’t been to the gym in ages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But most of all…</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I did <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/2344462557">a half marathon</a>! I didn’t die! I didn’t walk!</p>

<p>Seriously most of the half marathon was actually quite fun. It started out in Queen Elizabeth park and headed downtown, around Stanley Park and into downtown.</p>

<p>Until about 17km I was doing great with a sub 6 min/km pace, but I hit the proverbial wall in the last few km. The run uphill towards the finish (at 5:27 min/km pace I’ll add) was brutal. I ended up starting off with friends, but then running the whole thing by myself, which was probably the best thing.</p>

<p>Pretty proud of that one and I’ll have to beat my 2 h 8 min time next year.</p>
