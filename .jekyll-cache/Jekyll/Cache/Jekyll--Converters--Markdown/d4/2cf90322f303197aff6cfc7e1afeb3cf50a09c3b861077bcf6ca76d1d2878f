I"u<p>Most display's are still insanely expensive in this country. I should have bought one in Canada and shipped it over.</p>
<p>Cost in Apple store UK of a 23" display: <b>UK 779</b> which translates at today's exchange rate to being <b>US $1,538.05</b> (xe.com's rate of 1 USD = 0.506485 GBP). Cost in Apple store US of a 23" display: <b>US $899.00</b>.  Which is around a <b>70%</b> premium.</p>
<p>Cost in Dell store UK of a 20" display: <b>UK 229</b> which translates at today's exchange rate to being <b>US $452.171</b> (xe.com's rate of 1 USD = 0.506485 GBP). Cost in Dell store US of a 20" display:

<p>Must be expensive shipping that monitor all the extra way from China. That's a premium that Sony would be proud to have <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,2002678,00.html">on their PS3's</a>.</p>
