I"}<p><strong>My goal</strong>: I’m going to beat last years time of 4:19 and do the <a href="https://www.rbcgranfondo.com/whistler/">Whistler Gran Fondo</a> in September 2019 in 4 hours.</p>

<p>That seems absurdly ridiculous on the face of it, but the fact that I was able to shave off 23 minutes this year was nothing short of miraculous to me. So let’s try shaving off another 19 minutes. How am I going to do this?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Get serious about losing weight again. I’ve done it in the past and then I revert. This year I’m aiming for a race weight of 160 lbs. In the past I’ve been around 180 lbs by the time I do the Gran Fondo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improve my watts per kg. The amount of power you can output is important so I’ve got to lose weight without losing muscle. I did an estimated 236w power last Fondo, if I can do the some power output and weigh less I’ll push up my time.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Actual things I’m going to do to meet these goals:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do a half marathon. I’m in the <a href="https://bmovanmarathon.ca/">BMO Half</a> in May. I’ve done 4 10k races so far and I found the last one a bit slow and painful. I need to get comfortable at doing 5k every day and a 10k regularly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cycle regularly in the <a href="https://steedcycles.com/ride-clubs/">Steed group 2</a>. That’s the faster group than I normally ride in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complete the <a href="https://www.strava.com/segments/612178?filter=current_year">Seymour Hill Climb</a> in under 1 hour. My top time is 1:15:34 and according to Strava I’m 4924 / 6151. There’s room for improvement there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do lots of work at the gym to work on my core, leg and back muscles.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I can totally do this.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I might just say screw it and not do this. It’s my life.</p>
