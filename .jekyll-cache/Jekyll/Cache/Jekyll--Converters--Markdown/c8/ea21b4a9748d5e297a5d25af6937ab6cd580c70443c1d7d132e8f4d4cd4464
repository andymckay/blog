I"Ş<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_People_%28song%29">Twenty years ago (May 22nd 1995)</a>, Pulp released the single â€œCommon Peopleâ€:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that version is censored. At 2 mins 30 seconds the lyrics are:</p>

<blockquote>
You'll never watch your life slide out of view,<br />
and dance and drink and screw<br />
Because there's nothing else to do.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>The version on youtube omits â€œand screwâ€. This song has some great lyrics:</p>

<blockquote>
Smoke some fags and play some pool, pretend you never went to school.<br />
But still you'll never get it right<br />
'cos when you're laid in bed at night watching roaches climb the wall<br />
If you call your Dad he could stop it all.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>This was a defining song of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britpop">Britpop</a>
era and I can remember it clearly being part of an Oasis (Manchester) vs Pulp (London) rivalry.</p>

<p>Of course, you havenâ€™t made it until William Shatner covers it:</p>

<p>Of that Jarvis said:</p>

<blockquote>
In 2011 Jarvis Cocker praised the cover version: "I was very flattered by that because I was a massive Star Trek fan as a kid and so you know, Captain Kirk is singing my song! So that was amazing."

<p>Apparently the subject of song is a lady who might have been named Danae, my wifeâ€™s name.</p>

<p>There is a documentary about Pulp I havenâ€™t seen:</p>
