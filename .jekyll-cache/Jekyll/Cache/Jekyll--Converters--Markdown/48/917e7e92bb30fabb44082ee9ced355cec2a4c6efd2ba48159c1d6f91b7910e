I"‚<p>Found I was getting this error in Django running tests:  &lt;pre&gt;Got an error recreating the test database: must be owner of database test_clearwind &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did a bit of googling and took a while, so in case I get it again the answer is to run the following in psql:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;alter user django createdb;&lt;/pre&gt;Where django is the name of my user.</p>
