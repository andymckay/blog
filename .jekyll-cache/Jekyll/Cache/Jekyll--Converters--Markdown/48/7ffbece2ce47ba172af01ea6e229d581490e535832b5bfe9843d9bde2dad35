I"ª<p>Well actually, TalkTalk that my mother uses is great, if you don't mind the 3 month waiting list and the 18 month contract. Virgin, which I'm with because we needed something in a hurry when we came to the UK, is now running at 0.04 Mb/sec for the last few days. Not the "Up to 8 Mb sec" promised.</p>
<p>Time to start complaining to Ofcom or anyone who can do anything about it (no-one until the government wakes up I suppose). The result is that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/04/hidden_costs_of_watching_tv_on.html">wonderful initiatives</a> like iPlayer are rendered useless (it's unwatchable here). Only 8 months till back in western civilization.</p>
