I"<p>We are looking for some good quality DVDs for Emily (and Samantha). We donâ€™t have a TV here in Britain, and until recently, Emily would watch Simpsons and Futurama with us but not really taking much in. In fact, it didnâ€™t seem to matter what language it was played in or even if the sound was on! But the other day, the character Bender was acting drunk and Emily said â€œWhatâ€™s the matter with Bender?â€ We said, â€œOh dear, I guess she canâ€™t watch this anymore!â€ So now weâ€™re on the lookout for some age-appropriate stuff for her. She doesnâ€™t get a lot of â€œTVâ€ time, so short shows of 20-30 minutes are better than full movies. Also her attention span isnâ€™t long enough for a movie! But we want some good quality programs. Please pass along any ideas!<br /><br /></p>

<p>P.S. Not Baby Einstein stuff, please! I have issues with the concept, but thatâ€™s a whole new discussion!</p>
