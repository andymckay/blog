I"f<p>The definition that is generally used for bike packing is that you are cycling off road on gravel and camping. Bike touring is used when you are staying in accomodation. I like to do both on the same trip and don’t care about names. But if I’m going to go camping, I need a tent.</p>

<p>I also plan to do some back packing and the options I currently have are either too big and heavy: a four person or two person tent from MEC, or suit a particular trip - my camping hammock.</p>

<p>So I got a new tent, requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Light</li>
  <li>Packs small</li>
  <li>Can cope with most conditions</li>
  <li>Simple to put up</li>
</ul>

<p>I ended up looking at <a href="https://tarptent.com">tarptent</a> and got a <a href="https://www.tarptent.com/product/protrail-li/">ProTrail Li</a>. It’s super fast and easy to put up.</p>

<p>You can either carry your own poles, or re-use your own trekking poles. For cycling I’ve got poles I can use, when I’m backpacking I’ll re-use my hiking poles.</p>

<p>Weight is a ridiculous 453g.</p>

<p>It’s not designed for winter camping or snow, but that’s fine because that’s not something I intend to do anytime soon. It is a single wall tent, so we’ll see how it does with Pacific Northwest weather.</p>

<p><strong>Current status:</strong> I put it up in the garden but haven’t tried it for reals yet.</p>
