I"Õ<p>A new CBC site has been launched and looks quite nice so far. One nice change is that in a nice post, the person in charge has described <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/launch/" target="_blank">what and why</a>, for example:  &lt;blockquote&gt; We've added prominent links to RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds in the left-hand navigation of all of the news pages, so you can easily subscribe to feeds and get the news you wantâ€¦ &lt;/blockquote&gt;  Good stuff.</p>
