I"C<p>So I've got this neat Django app that pulls together photo's linked in with locations on a google map. I want to scroll through those photos using a nice little Ajax or Flash app that does all those nice things like cross fading and browsing. There's loads out there, but they've all got server requirements like php. I haven't found anything that takes a xhtml page, parses the DOM and produces the photo viewer from that.&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At least I haven't found one, I must be blind. Anyone got any recommendations?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold">Update:</span> the excellent Scott Schiller seems to have a nice app here<a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/35mm/" target="_blank">http://www.schillmania.com/projects/35mm/</a> but I'm not sure I like the interface I found it confusing, I'm sure my mother would. Seems to herald from Vancouver so gets lots of bonus points for that. But looks damn good, might be the fella.</span>&lt;/div&gt;</p>
