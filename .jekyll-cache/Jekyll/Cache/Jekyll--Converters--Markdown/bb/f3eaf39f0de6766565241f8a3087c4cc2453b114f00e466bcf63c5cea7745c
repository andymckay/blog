<p>Any chance I could get some testers for Clouseau? I think I’m ready for a first release and want to check it works. During the sprint we had IE, FF on Linux and Safari testing it… I made a few changes and heard rumours that “it didn’t work” without anyone providing any feedback on what that meant. Recent builds are only tested on OS X though. So if you’ve got 5 minutes and can throw it in your test environment that would be great.</p>

<p>(And if that instance is publicly accessible, great, then I can test too).</p>

<p>Zip file: <a href="/files/Clouseau.0.1.zip">/files/Clouseau.0.1.zip</a> (or from the collective)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> requires Zope 2.9+. Tested on Plone 2.5.</p>
