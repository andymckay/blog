I"÷<p>At the one year anniversary at Mozilla many people write a blog post. I thought about it, but the date whizzed past. Two years passed and nary a blog post was in sight. Itâ€™s now been three years and about time I wrote one.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s still quite surprising to me I get to be employed at Mozilla  I know that is just  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>, but Iâ€™m surrounded by so many awesome people that itâ€™s hard not to feel that way. Still, many thanks to <a href="http://morgamic.com/">Mike</a> and <a href="http://micropipes.com/blog/">Wil</a> for giving me that chance in the first place.</p>

<p>Also, to me, itâ€™s slightly surprising that Iâ€™ve stayed this long at Mozilla. If you read my resume, it normally takes me about two years to find myself bored and move on. Hard to get bored at Mozilla.</p>

<p>So how about some numbers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>11 LDAP password resets survived without having to ask for help. I got the first one wrong somehow. Now Iâ€™m a pro.</li>
  <li>1,176 bugs filed, thatâ€™s 1.073 bugs a day.</li>
  <li>1,153 bugs completed thatâ€™s 1.052 bugs a day.</li>
  <li>44 github repositories started, of which about 50% are completely useless.</li>
  <li>60% speed increase by moving Firefox version check from PHP to Python. Itâ€™s since sped up by 300%.</li>
  <li>7am - earliest meeting on my current calendar.</li>
  <li>0 emails sent to everyone@mozilla.com</li>
  <li>0 accidental replies to emails sent to everyone@mozilla.com</li>
  <li>17 irc.mozilla.org channels currently open in my client.</li>
  <li>3 Firefox OS phones currently in the house.</li>
  <li>1 drawer stuffed with Mozilla t-shirts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s been a great three years. Looking forward to the next three.</p>
