I"÷<p>One thing Iâ€™ve enjoyed doing the last year is taking a bit of a step away from being blinkered solely on Plone and Zope and take a look around at other things out there. And no surprise -  all these fancy new frameworks out there donâ€™t actually solve some problems. The exact same problems and patterns exist out there. All too often in IRC channels or from managers Iâ€™ve heard an answer like â€œso if move away from Plone weâ€™ll fix this problemâ€. Chances are you wonâ€™t, chances are other frameworkâ€™s have the same problem.</p>

<p>Take for example the â€œpulling large amount of data from a remote sourceâ€ situation. Iâ€™ve seen this now in Plone, Zope, Ruby on Rails and heard about it Drupal. The problem is simple, youâ€™ve got a source that contains a large amount of records, such as a SQL server or and LDAP server. You write code to show the first 20 users and but the rest behind next links. Works with 10, 20, 200 users. Now throw 5 million in there and what happens. It falls over.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a pattern that developers (like myself) need to learn and in LDAPâ€™s case its a limitation of the tool. OpenLDAP has recently started to support this kind of â€œgive me records 200-300 out of this possible 1,000 recordsâ€ but no fiddling on the framework is going to change that. I was in a Drupal birds of a feather and I remember hearing them say â€œoh yeah when our LDAP server has 20,000 users in (number made up) the admin tool for browsing gets really slowâ€. Yep same thing.</p>

<p>Many times Alan Runyan is right, one talk in particular that stuck in head was a talk at the last New Orleans conference. At that he was asking people to focus on reusability, not re-invention (although his point was probably deeper than that).</p>

<p>And donâ€™t get me started on how Django is crippling itself with re-inventing yet another templating language and simultaneously natching defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>

<p><em>Side note:</em> Just to compound the problem in the Ruby on Rails app was that it was looking for a change on the input box every second and firing off a request to the server, returning a huge recordset every time. Thereâ€™s a reason Google doesnâ€™t have this on their home page you know.</p>

<p>Okay rant over, on with the show.</p>
