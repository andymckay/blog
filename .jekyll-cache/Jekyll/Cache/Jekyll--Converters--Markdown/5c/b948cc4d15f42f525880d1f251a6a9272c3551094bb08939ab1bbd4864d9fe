I"R<p>Yay, new MacBook was ordered today. It’s the cheapest one they have, I’m such a cheap person with things like laptop’s but at the moment finances are a little shorter than usual. Besides, it will just mean upgrading in a year or two or when I break it :)</p>

<p>Next task - go and find some RAM to get that <a href="http://nateaune.com/2006/06/09/macbook-on-the-way/">seriously upgraded from the base 512</a>.</p>

<p>Going back to a sole development box will be nice, in the last year I’ve been jumping between a Windows Sony Vaio (which I like but it doesn’t run OS X) and my Mac mini (too slow). With tools like QuickSilver, terminal and even insanely simple things like symlinks, I find myself just way more productive on a Unix-like platform than on Windows.</p>

<p>So c’mon Apple get that laptop to me as fast as possible.</p>
