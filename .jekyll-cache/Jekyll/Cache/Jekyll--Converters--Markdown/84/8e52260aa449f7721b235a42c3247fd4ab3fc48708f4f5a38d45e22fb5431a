I"e<p>tl;dr: Let’s remove parking on Gallant, remove 3 of the car lanes on part of Gallant Ave., or remove all vehicle access to part of Gallant Ave.</p>

<p>So you want to go to Deep Cove by cycle? Maybe to get an ice cream or put your dip your feet in the sea. Getting to Deep Cove by bicycle isn’t easy, but that’s the subject for another post.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough the District of North Vancouver wants you to cycle there and keep encouraging people to do so. Even though for most people its really not safe to do so:</p>

<p>And if you look at the <a href="https://twitter.com/NVanDistrict/status/1134887606339166208">replies to that tweet</a>, you can see the sort of scorn it receives.</p>

<p>If you are visiting one of the merchants here’s where your problem begins. In the summer months, its packed. Gallant Avenue goes through the centre of the village and it has room for 1 lane each way and car storage on either side.</p>

<p>I’m going to focus on the part outlined in the black rectangle:</p>

<p>How much space is there for bikes, pedestrians and cafes? This much:</p>

<p><img src="/files/deep-cove-sidewalk.jpg" /></p>

<p>Where do you store your bike? In the village there is no space to lock up your bike other than these little bike poles that can take maybe two bikes at a time:</p>

<p>And that’s it.</p>

<p>If you decide to go down to the water then there’s multiple bike lock ups in a few places:</p>

<p>Perhaps the idea is that you lock up your bike and then walk back to the shops. The car spots that take up so much space are 1 hour parking all the time, so they aren’t intended for local residents.</p>

<h3 id="how-could-we-make-this-better">How could we make this better?</h3>

<p>Cars and the storage of cars take up most of the public space between the shops. We could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Remove a couple of car storage spots, turn them into bike storage. In Toronto (yes Toronto) one car spot can be used for eight bicycles. There are xxx spots in the cove that could be replaced by bike storage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove all the car storage on Gallant Ave and just expand the sidewalks, give the cafes and business more space. Throw in some more bike storage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-could-we-make-this-even-better">How could we make this even better?</h3>

<p>Block cars from going all the way down Gallant Ave and instead divert them around Panorama, Naughton and then Banbury. In fact the District of North Vancouver has already built a handy turn around at the bottom of Gallant Ave.</p>

<p>This would divert that 4 car wide area into a pedestrian and cafe zone. Businesses would be able to spill out into this area and pedestrian and bikes would have more space. It would be great for pedestrians and businesses.</p>

<p>Because there’s a road parking there, cars drive by continually. Then go around Panorama, Naughton and Banbury already looking for spaces. In the summer its a continual crawl of cars hoping for a parking spot.</p>

<p>There is one problem, buses stop on Panorama drive. Then they do the Naughton, Banbury and Gallant Ave loop. I don’t know if its possible for buses to take another route out of Deep Cove - there are others. If that’s not the case we make Gallant Ave into a 1 lane one way bus only drive that accepts buses going east to west.</p>

<p>Not quite the pedestrian area that most people would like but better than what we have now.</p>

<p>Note: If we are removing the car spots there’s two blue badge spots on the south side. We could move those west one block and probably not inconvenience people.</p>
