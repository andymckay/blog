I"Õ<p>The quality of news is not very high, slashdot is proving much better most of the time. Take this article:</p>

<p>http://digg.com/apple/Macbook_Outselling_iPod</p>

<blockquote>I noticed that the iPod video [#4 top seller] is being outsold by the MacBook [#2 top seller after the nano]</blockquote>

<p>that ended up on the front page:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Wait a second, the top seller is the iPod, its the iPod Nano. The headline is that MacBook outsells the iPod. It may sell more at that one instance than the <em>iPod video</em>, but in the same sentance you are saying the <em>iPod Nano</em> is top. Your headline is totally wrong.</li>
	<li>Where does it say on the store page that the order implies well anything. Its says:  "Top Sellers:  iPod nano, MacBook etc". There is nothing to tell you the order, that's implied.</li>
	<li>How long is this data based on, 10 minutes, 1 day (did someone just order a lot of MacBooks, eg a company).</li>
</ol>

<p>Just annoying you see something on the front page like this, but its a) wrong and b) questionable data even if it was right. Iâ€™ve got nothing against the person reporting it, just the people who float it up to the top of digg. And this is just one of many items on there.</p>
