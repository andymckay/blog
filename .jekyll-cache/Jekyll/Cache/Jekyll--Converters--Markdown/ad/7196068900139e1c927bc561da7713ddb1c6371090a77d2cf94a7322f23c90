I"è<p>The definition that is generally used for bike packing is that you are cycling off road on gravel and camping. Bike touring is used when you are staying in accomodation. I like to do both on the same trip and donâ€™t care about names. But if Iâ€™m going to go camping, I need a tent.</p>

<p>I also plan to do some back packing and the options I currently have are either too big and heavy: a four person or two person tent from MEC, or suit a particular trip - my camping hammock.</p>

<p>So I got a new tent, requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Light</li>
  <li>Packs small</li>
  <li>Can cope with most conditions</li>
  <li>Simple to put up</li>
</ul>

<p>I ended up looking at <a href="https://tarptent.com">tarptent</a> and got a <a href="https://www.tarptent.com/product/protrail-li/">ProTrail Li</a>. Itâ€™s super fast and easy to put up.</p>

<p>You can either carry your own poles, or re-use your own trekking poles. For cycling Iâ€™ve got poles I can use, when Iâ€™m backpacking Iâ€™ll re-use my hiking poles.</p>

<p>Weight is a ridiculous 453g.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not designed for winter camping or snow, but thatâ€™s fine because thatâ€™s not something I intend to do anytime soon. It is a single wall tent, so weâ€™ll see how it does with Pacific Northwest weather.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Iâ€™ve slept out under the tent 3 nights now. Iâ€™ve found it draughty.</p>

<p>Probably because Iâ€™m putting it up wrong, Iâ€™ve found a significant gap between the outer tent and the floor. Iâ€™ve had multiple occassions where Iâ€™ve felt the wind just gusting through.</p>

<p>Got to keep experimenting on this, perhaps I can improve things.</p>
