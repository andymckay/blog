I"Ï<p>Today is my last day at Mozilla as a paid employee. Seven and a half years at Mozilla has been a heck of ride. I feel lucky and honoured to have had such an awesome opportunity.</p>

<p>In terms projects Iâ€™ve gone from AMO, through the Firefox OS Marketplace, through Marketplace Payments, then back to AMO and <a href="2017-10-27-here-we-are/WebExtensions">WebExtensions</a>. Those last couple of years, as we rebooted the add-ons, ecosystem was probably my proudest moment professionally.</p>

<p>But more importantly Iâ€™ve met so many great people here. I was so pleasantly surprised to find my journey at Mozilla produce so many good friends. These are smart, caring, dedicated professionals who make a difference to Mozilla, Firefox and the open web. I think Mozilla is in great hands and Iâ€™ll miss every single one of them.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s next? <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.</p>
