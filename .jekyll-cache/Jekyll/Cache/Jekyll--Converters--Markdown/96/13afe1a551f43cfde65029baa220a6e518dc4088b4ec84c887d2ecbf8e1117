I"ý<p>I get annoyed by the Plone instance that installed using the OS X installer starting automatically. Iâ€™m now at the stage of having 5 Plone instances, 3 Zope versions and they all run ZEO which doesnâ€™t start up automatically, leaving Zope wedged. Fortunately I only restart the once a month or so when my MacBook freezes or the next BIOS patch comes in. Itâ€™s fixed by removing: <em>/Library/StartupItems/Plone-2.5</em>. In fact I found a few other things in there I didnâ€™t want and removed too.</p>
