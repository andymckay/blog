I"Í<p>Plone star Chris Calloway has been devoting time and lots of CPU time to generating code swarms for Plone and the Collective. It's been kinda fun to watch them and I confess look out for my own name. If you watch the Collective one, it's crazy with so many people. But I did spot an interesting one, bobbling around in the middle of the Collective for a while is troberts, that Toby Roberts of Enfold Systems to you and me. No-one is probably more surprised than Toby - a non-programmer and the Plone Foundation treasurer - to see himself in there. Go Toby!</p>
