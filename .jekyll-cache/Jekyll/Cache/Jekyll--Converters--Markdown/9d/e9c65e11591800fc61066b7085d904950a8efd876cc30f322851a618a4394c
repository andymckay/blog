I"ã	<p>Many years ago when I had just started working in tech properly, I was had a huge amount of imposter syndrome. It felt like I was struggling every day to get my job done and understand the basic things. One day we were in a company meeting and the CEO said:</p>

<blockquote>If that person comes to me and says "I can't do my job", its my job to find a replacement for him.</blockquote>

<p>I was mortified. I just heard:</p>

<blockquote>You cannot come to with any problem because I will think you can't do your job and replace you.</blockquote>

<p>Later on, when Iâ€™d stopped caring about working in that company, I brought this up to the CEO. He said it was taken out of context and I could come to him with problems. The truth was, I really couldnâ€™t. That one line had put me in a state of indecision for many months. There were so many better ways to say what he said such as: â€œit my job to work with that employee to find a way to help themâ€ etc. But the CEO at the time wasnâ€™t that kind of a person.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve taken this to heart because people apply their own context to things you say. The context at work includes things like: your position in the org chart relevant to that person, your experiences in similar situations. For example: if your boss says â€œyou are doing a great jobâ€, is that different from your mother saying â€œyou are doing a great jobâ€?</p>

<p>Of course it does, the context for the person hearing it is applied. This became clear to me quickly as a manager when off the cuff minor technical decision became an issue. A junior person said (paraphrasing) â€œwe should do it this way because Andy said soâ€. Another person replied (paraphrasing again) â€œdonâ€™t do it because Andy said so, do it because its rightâ€. Both reported to me, but the first person had assumed that because I had said it, it must be the way to go. The other (and more experienced person) correctly pointed out the need to critically think about what Iâ€™d said.</p>

<p>As you get higher up the chain of responsibility within an organisation this gets harder and harder. Thatâ€™s why you often see senior people think before they say anything. What they say will be interpreted by different people differently and lead to mis-interpretation. The more people you have in that organisation and the more diverse it is, the more different contexts will applied.</p>

<p>For that reason Iâ€™m trying to stop and think more before responding with something that might be prone to mis-interpretation.</p>
