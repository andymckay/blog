I"l<p>Over Christmas we got some nuts in our stockings. But we couldn't find a nutcracker, so my nephew and I devised some silly ways to try and crack the nuts. I stupidly said "it would be cool if we put the nut on your target and you shot an arrow at it".</p>
<p>A few days later, Daniel decided to give it a try. In the snow and freezing temperatures (well it was balmy zero degrees in the north of British Columbia) he got his bow out. That's when I realized his bow was no ordinary bow, it's <a href="#firefox">Firefox</a>.</p>

<p>We taped the nut to the target Daniel took aim...</p>

<p>As it turns out hitting an almond with an arrow is no easy feat.</p>

<cite>A bigger nut is a possibility, but didnâ€™t want to break the arrows.</cite></p>
<p>But Daniel didn't give up and eventually got it.</p>

<p>That's a nut that took a lot of work to crack, which is probably why someone invented nutcrackers.</p>
