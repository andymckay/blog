I"¶<p>I've phone Virgin 4 times today to get a MAC code so I can calmly and smoothly move to another ISP. Any ISP would do. However first time told to call different number. Called different number on hold 20 minutes. Called again on hold 1 hour 30 mintues. Called again on hold 15 minutes. Gave up. Fumed a lot. Tried their web site, it's broken. Go and cancel bank direct debit since thats the only way to get any attention from them.</p>
