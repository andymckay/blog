I"˜<p>My sleeping bags are optimized for what I started doing in my old age, camping now and again in the summer when its hot. If I barely needed a sleeping bag? Thatâ€™s the time to go camping.</p>

<p>Not so with the crazy bike packing trips I had in mind. I need something better.</p>

<p>By better it needed to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lightweight</li>
  <li>Pack down small</li>
  <li>Warm and cope with a couple of seasons</li>
</ul>

<p>I ended up with the Spark Ultralight Sleeping Bag from <a href="https://seatosummit.com/products/spark-ultralight-sleeping-bag-series">Sea to Summit</a>:</p>

<p>Its ultralight at 340g, made with ethically sourced down. It covers a couple of seasons of the year. It packs down really small and in my quick test seemed ultra warm.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Iâ€™ve slept out three nights with the bag now.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s light, it packs down well but I feel like Iâ€™m at the tolerance of warmth for the sleeping bag. It goes down to -2c and is listed as <strong>two seasons</strong>. Iâ€™d hate to get a whole lot colder with this sleeping bag and Iâ€™ve had a couple of nights close to zero.</p>

<p>It could also be the combination of the tent, which Iâ€™m not sure is ideal for windy weather.</p>
