I"û<p>For my <a href="https://mckay.pub/2022-04-24-first-trip/">first trip</a> I used <a href="https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5047-621/Division-Double-Pannier">these panniers</a> from MEC that were on my wifeâ€™s bike already. There was a few downsides I discovered with these panniers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They arenâ€™t that big.</li>
  <li>They arenâ€™t waterproof.</li>
  <li>The velcro to hold it down doesnâ€™t always stick.</li>
</ul>

<p>They are fine for the trips my wife does, to and from school which takes 10 minutes. They hold up to the worst Vancouver rain for 10 minutes. However 8 hours of rain is another story, they got wet inside. Plus the velcro didnâ€™t stay shut and then I worried about things falling out.</p>

<p>So I ended up with <a href="https://waterflyshop.com/products/waterfly-bike-pannier-bag">these panniers</a>. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bigger, holding 25L according to the spec.</li>
  <li>Waterproof, although I havenâ€™t had them in 8 hours of rain yet.</li>
  <li>Will stay closed thanks to lots of clips.</li>
</ul>

<p>The downside is that they are not light.</p>

<p>On my first trip I was able to get all my usual gear in and have space for more. The sidepockets were really helpful for storing phones and tools in. So far, quite happy.</p>
