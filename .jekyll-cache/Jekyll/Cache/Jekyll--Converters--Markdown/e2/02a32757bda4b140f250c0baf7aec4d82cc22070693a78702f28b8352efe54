I"œ<p>Just about to leave for a weeks holiday prior to the Plone conference in Naples. I'll be there and I'm still touting Clouseau as my fun project. So I'll probably run a birds of a feather session on Clouseau during the conference, but if anyone is interested in a few "corridor sprints" during the conference, then let me know. I'm game for any new features I don't have to write :).</p>
<p>See you there.</p>
