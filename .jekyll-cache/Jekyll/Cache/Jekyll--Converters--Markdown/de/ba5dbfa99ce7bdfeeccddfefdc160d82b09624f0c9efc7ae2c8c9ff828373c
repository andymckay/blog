I"ý<p>Almost 3 years ago I wrote that thing for the book, PloneSilverCity. Iâ€™ve started to rewrite that for 2006 and update it a bit.</p>

<p>From the readme:</p>

<blockquote>
    This is a complete rewrite of PloneSilverCity from the 
    original version of Definitive Guide to Plone. Thats about
    three years old, so I wanted to rewrite it to ensure that
    
    - we use best practices including unit and functional tests
    
    - we use archetypes as opposed to CMF types
    
    I'm retaining the name, although we'll no longer use SilverCity, 
    instead we'll use dpSyntaxHighligher, a javascript solution. This
    allows for zero dependencies.
    
    If you have Zelenium installed, when you install this product
    it will create a set of Zelenium tests that you can run pointing
    at the tests/selenium directory.
    
    To run those tests go to http://yoursite/zelenium/silvercity, but 
    note you must have a user name and password admin/admin.
</blockquote>

<p>Got to fix up that Zelenium stuff. When itâ€™s done Iâ€™ll plonk on plone.org, for nowâ€¦</p>
