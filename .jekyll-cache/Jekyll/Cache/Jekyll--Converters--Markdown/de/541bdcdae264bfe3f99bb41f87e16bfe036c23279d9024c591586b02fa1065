I"<p>About a year ago I was elected to the Django Software Foundation board as the Secretary. My main reason for taking on that role was to increase transparency into the foundations activities. Since then we’ve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Published a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/records/">record of meeting notes</a> after every board meeting.  Almost every thing discussed in those meetings is added to those minutes. Some highly sensitive legal or personal issues might have been truncated.</li>
  <li>Published documentation about <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/committees/">the committees</a>.</li>
  <li>Published an <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/reports/2013/">annual report</a> that details all the activities of board over the year. This annual report also discloses the financial status of the foundation.</li>
  <li>The board plans to discuss status at <a href="http://www.djangocon.us/">DjangoCon US</a>, similar to previous years.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this information can be found at <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/records/">djangoproject.com</a>. But I’d like to see what more we can do. Is there anything you’d like to know about the foundation and it’s activities? If so, drop me a line.</p>
