I"n<p>Yes, I’ve fallen into the Facebook trap… It’s all my sister’s fault. She was the first to invite me and I figured if she invited me it must be worthwhile. Well, I now have 50 friends on Facebook and am enjoying getting in touch with people I haven’t seen in years, but it is sooooo easy to waste time there!<br /><br /></p>

<p>On the bright side, now that I know what I’m doing, it’s easy to go on and spend a quick 5 minutes seeing what’s new and then log off again. Trouble is, I find myself doing this a lot. The kids’ playroom is also the computer room, so if they’re playing nicely I find myself logging on… or if Sam happens to sleep at the same time as Emily has quiet time, why do housework when I can Facebook? (Is that a verb, by the way?)<br /><br /></p>

<p>Anyway, that’s my little rant. Time to check if I have any new friends. ;o)</p>
