I"Ç<p>Lifeâ€™s too busy right now to write any interesting postsâ€¦ was going to write more about our trip to Cambridge and London last weekend, and about our visit to Beatrix Potterâ€™s house and gallery in the Lake Disrict this Saturday, but with our trip to Vancouver looming, Iâ€™m just too busy with packing and everything! So it will have to wait a bit. Hopefully Iâ€™ll have time to write a few posts while in Canada. So keep watching this space!</p>
