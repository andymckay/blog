I"@<p>It’s pretty much a given that Friday is the best day of the week. Monday maybe  the worst and Wednesday is “hump day”. In fact for many people Sunday is the  most stressful night of the week, it presents anxiety and stress about the upcoming week.</p>

<p>I’ve been in jobs that I didn’t enjoy and I can understand this. The dread of checking your email and finding emails full of problems, issues that need to be addressed and so on. It’s not a good place to be.</p>

<p>But at the moment? It’s the opposite way round, by Friday I’m a bit fried from a weeks work, I really look forward to a weekend away from work and time to spend with the family. A chance to clear the brain.</p>

<p>By the time Monday comes around? I’m actually pumped, Monday is full of promise and excitement about the things that are going to get accomplished. The bugs that will be fixed, the problems solved. Nothing but hope and excitement about what will happen that week.</p>

<p>I think I’m pretty lucky.</p>

<p>Who is this optimistic person and what has he done with Andy McKay?</p>
