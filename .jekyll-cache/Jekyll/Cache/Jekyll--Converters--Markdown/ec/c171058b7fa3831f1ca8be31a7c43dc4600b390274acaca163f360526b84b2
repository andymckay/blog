I"«<p>If you play Final Fantasy XI, then there are quite a few hacks out there that you can try. Iâ€™ve been playing it for a while and hereâ€™s a simple one, swap your moogle for something else. All you are doing is changing the .dat file that renders the image of the moogle. Thereâ€™s something mildly amusing about asking a Gigas to do your gardening for example, although it is freaky the first time you go into your Mog house.</p>
