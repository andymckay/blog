I"Å<p>So the web site for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) didn‚Äôt go so well. That‚Äôs not really surprising, a web site for that many government departments, agencies and states is destined to failure. Everything will have to be RFP‚Äôd to different contractors and bidders. It will get so insanely complex that even getting the main job done will be next to impossible. I‚Äôm pretty impressed it launched at all.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve done plenty of those RFPs and they aren‚Äôt fun. My favourite was one for the BC Government for a very simple site. But the amount of project management overhead was amazing. Three meetings a week to three different departments in two different cities, in person over the course of the project. I didn‚Äôt apply for that RFP.</p>

<p>Taking a quick look at the site, I‚Äôm slightly amused that a deep page in the site loads 64 external Javascript files and 13 CSS files.</p>

<p>But what‚Äôs more interesting is that it is just a web site. A lowly old web site is able to be the centre of attention and to be the corner stone of a Government policy to fix the US insane and dysfunctional health care system. A registration portal for millions upon millions of people to actually get health care. That‚Äôs pretty cool and not something you see every day.</p>

<p>And how often have we seen a head of state give a key address specifically about a web site. Again, pretty cool. Unless you worked on that site, eh <a href="http://www.cgi.com/en">CGI</a>? The probably need more <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=synergy+site:cgi.com">synergy</a>.</p>

<p>It won‚Äôt fix the US health care system though.</p>
