I"Í<p>Had to laugh when saw these at our local supermarket. For those of you without kids, these are diaper liners. They go on the diaper, so when the kid has a poo you can flush this down the toilet. Leaving the diaper ready to be cleaned (or back to the diaper service). I&#39;ve seen some code that needs flushing down the toilet, and there&#39;s probably some PHP that needs flushing too I&#39;m sure...</p>
