I"ë<p>Well, as we expected, 24 hours after we started Sam on the eye drops, Emilyâ€™s eyes started to run green goo too. Turns out she is much better at having eye drops put in than I expected. It still takes 2 of us to do it, but if one of us cradles her gently, she doesnâ€™t struggle too much. If I try to do it myself, though, itâ€™s next to impossible! Iâ€™m getting good at doing Sams though. Both of them have cleared up a lot, but we have to keep doing the drops for 5-7 days. Ugh!</p>
