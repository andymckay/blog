I"j<p><a href="http://plone.org/news/plone-3.0-released">Plone is released</a>. This is probably the biggest release in a long time and from an end user point of view, the largest number of visible changes and tweaks. Well done to all the team involved.</p>
<p>On the top end most visible are the ajaxification of most of the content editing and the addition of versioning. Behind the scenes its all the Zope 3 stuff and rewriting of all the architecture. I don't understand most of that stuff, so I can just hope its all a good thing. But if you haven't tried Plone in a while, should take another quick peek at it.</p>
